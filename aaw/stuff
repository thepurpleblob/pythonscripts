INTRO  The effects of fascism have been studied extensively: many historians try to ignore associations between fascism and Christianity. 
    QUESTION 0 Is the colon in this sentence properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A colon should introduce a list, or expand on the information that precedes it.  If a colon is correctly used, you can usually swap it for the phrase 'that is to say'.  In this case, a new topic has been introduced.  Topic 1 is the effects of Fascism.  Topic 2 concerns historians.  I think these sentences would be better separated by a full stop.
        ANSWER: No.

    QUESTION 0 Is the colon in this text properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Colons introduce lists - in this case a list of questions.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the colon is properly used.  Colons introduce lists - and here we have a list of questions.

    QUESTION 0 Is the semi-colon correctly used in sentence 1?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  In sentence 1 we have two sentences closely linked.  Each could stand alone, but a semi-colon helps the text to flow.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Here we have two sentences closely linked.  Each could stand alone, but a semi-colon helps the text to flow.  You wouldn't have to use a semi-colon here but its use is quite correct.
    QUESTION 1 Is the colon used properly in sentence 2?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The second part of  sentence 2 gives specific illustrations of what has been asserted in the first part of the sentence.  In contrast, the second part of sentence 1 is closely linked to the first part, but makes a more general point.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The second part of  sentence 2 gives specific illustrations of what has been asserted in the first part of the sentence.  In contrast, the second part of sentence 1 is closely linked to the first part, but makes a more general point.

    QUESTION 0 In which sentence is the colon used correctly?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The list of names here flows into the sentence.  A list is not flagged up by stating a number.  There's no need for any punctuation before 'Durkheim'.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  In this sentence, a list is flagged up by stating a number - 'will examine three etc.  In sentence 1, where a number is not flagged up, the names flow into the sentence.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />What can the literature on fundamentalism and creationism tell us about the problems of modern society?</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism and creationism fundamentally reject the modern world, and this rejection in itself describes one major problem of the modern world:  a sense of alienation.  This sense is witnessed by ...
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines fulfil one of the major criteria of a good opening line:  they grab the author's attention.  I like the fact that we're also to get an example early on.  A powerful opening and the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Modern society has many problems and the literature on fundamentalism and creationism tells us a great deal about those problems.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the question.  It tells us nothing.  Nor does it open the essay up.  We wouldn't miss this line if it was removed from the essay.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism is 'strict adherence to a specific set of theological doctrines typically in reaction against the theology of Modernism' (Wikipedia 2011).
        FEEDBACK: Although beginning your essay with a defining quotation is a good technique, wikipedia is not a reliable source of information.  For this reason, this is a poor choice.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Why was the New Economic Policy (NEP) adopted in 1921 but then abandoned only seven years later?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        ANSWER: This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the terms of the question.  Nothing is added and it does not open up the essay in any way.  If you removed this line, the essay would be none the poorer.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Marx and Engels both saw communism as a logical step in societal evolution but if communism was the next step forward from industrial capitalism, then Russia would not have been either Marx or Engels' choice for the experiment.  As they ask in the preface to the 1882 edition of the Communist Manifesto ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines are informative but opening lines need to seize the essay question directly.  All this information may be useful within the essay, but as opening lines these are unhelpful.
        ANSWER: The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1921 as a direct result of a collapse in production following an international war and a internal revolution.  The reasons for its abandonment are more complex, but an analysis of these reasons shows not just why the NEP lasted only seven years, but also how its own structure meant that failure in the long term was inevitable.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines address the question directly.  They add information and they open up the question in an interesting way.  These lines are the best choice.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Critically analyse the effectiveness of public policy in meeting the needs of women.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Throughout the ages, women have been seen as the 'weaker' sex.  In ancient Greece, for example, long hailed as an example of democracy, women were not seen as equal to men.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines are much too general.  They might do for an article in a tabloid newspaper but simply waste words in an academic essay.  In an academic essay, you need to seize the subject from the very start. Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: That any public policy in 21st century should have to address specifically the needs of women shows that public policy directed at women's equality has been ineffective.  However, this may be more to do with women's expectations than public policy failure.  For example, ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines certainly grab the reader's attention.  Confident and controversial, they would make any reader want to read on.  The best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Women have a pretty rough ride as I know from experience.  In 2010, my mother is still not being paid the same as her male counterparts.  Public policy is pretty ineffective if it cannot even guarantee the same wage for the same job.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too anecdotal and colloquial.   With a few tweaks - for example using the experience of the writer's mother in a more objective way, with hard evidence attached - they could be transformed into lines suitable for an academic essay.  As they stand, however, these lines are not the best choice here.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />What were the main challenges facing public health in the 19th century and how were these challenges overcome?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Urbanisation, attitudes towards health, poor diet, poor housing and environmental degradation were all challenges to public health in the 19th century.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line gets straight to the point.  The best option here.
        ANSWER: During the 19th century, many things changed in Britain and across the whole of Europe.  
        FEEDBACK: This sentence adds nothing to the essay, simply repeating the terms of the question.  We wouldn't miss this opening line if it were deleted.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Throughout history, nations have faced challenges in public health, but it is only within the last three hundred years that public health has become an issue of real concern.  In 14th century, for example, people were certainly worried about catching the plague and some containment policies were put in place.  However,  you could hardly call this a start to overcoming public health challenges.
        FEEDBACK: These lines tell us something, but they don't get straight into the question.  In an academic essay in Social and Political Science, you should not waste time on a potted history unless it's a necessary part of the answer to the essay question.  This is not the best option on offer here.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Essay question:<br /><br /></font>How, in some European societies, did World War I create favourable preconditions for the emergence of Fascist parties?<br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: There is a general consensus amongst those who study World War 1 that it left a lasting impact on world politics.  It was, after all, the Great War; the War to End All Wars.  Ten million men lost their lives and it is generally agreed that the world was never the same again.
        FEEDBACK: These lines start well, but the second line begins to drift.  Make sure you stick firmly to the question in your opening lines.  First impressions are very important.
        ANSWER: Three conditions are necessary for the emergence of fascism: nationalist ideology; a charismatic leader and a political environment which provides democratic legitimacy.  By looking closely at the legacy of World War I, it is possible to identify certain preconditions which gave birth to these conditions, and this essay will explore these preconditions with particular reference to Germany and Spain.
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear and confident start.  The reader learns something important from the first sentence, and the second sentence provides an essay map.   These lines are the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: World War I (1914-1918) was a conflict caused by a number of factors, but the immediate catalyst was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by a Serb.  This assassination set in motion a war of mass carnage, which dragged on until finally ending with Germany's humiliation at the Treaty of Versailles.
        FEEDBACK: Nothing here is wrong - except that by the end of these lines a reader who had not seen the question would have no idea what the essay was supposed to be about.  There is no mention of fascism.  Every fact in your first lines must be relevant to the essay question.  However well written they are, if your first lines are just a wander through history, they'll gain you no marks.
    Writing activity 7. Concluding lines
        Task multiplechoice difficulty 2
INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Is fascism necessarily anti-Christian?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: It is clear, then, that one of fascism's most devious strengths is its principle of adapting and gathering   to itself other creeds, even ones seemingly inimical to its beliefs. Fascism is, therefore, not necessarily anti-Christian because it is not, by necessity, anti anything at all.
        FEEDBACK: These are strong closing lines that come to a thought-provoking conclusion.  These are the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Unfortunately, as this essay has proven, we do not as yet fully understand the relationship between fascism and Christianity.
        FEEDBACK: The statement made by these concluding lines may be true but the lines leave the reader with a sense of anti-climax.  The essay question asked for an answer.  If there is no answer, try not to finish your essay with a sentence beginning 'unfortunately', since this leaves a clear impression of defeat.  These lines are not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: In addition, we might remember that the term 'clerical-fascism' is an oxymoron, which leaves us with the question:  were these Catholic states fascist at all?
        FEEDBACK: Rhetorical questions are not good ways to finish an essay.  Rhetorical question smack of journalism, not academia.  These lines are not the best choice here.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Why was there famine in Ireland but not in Scotland in the 1840s?<br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: As has been seen, diversity of crops, a more prosperous economy and famine relief schemes were key to Scotland avoiding famine in the 1840s. In Ireland, failure to address any of these issues in time meant that famine was an inevitable result of potato blight.  When combined with the policies of the British government, mass starvation was unavoidable.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines briefly recapitulate the themes of the essay in order to give a satisfactory answer to the essay question. These are the best lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: There were also other causes of the famine, for example landlords mismanaging their lands, but these do not truly account for the differences in the effects of famine between Scotland and Ireland.
        FEEDBACK: These lines rather drift to a halt, and it is always a mistake to bring in new ideas right at the end of an essay.  If there are topics you cannot include for space reasons, but you want to make reference to them, the introduction is the right place to mention them, not the conclusion.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: It was a truly terrible time for the Irish and the British government should apologise and hang its head in shame.
        FEEDBACK: You may think this, but an academic essay is not the place to air such views unless specifically asked to do so by the essay question.  Not the best choice here.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Why should housing policy seek to make a contribution towards improving people's physical health?</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Housing policy plays an important role in people's mental health and so policies should be put in place that reflect this.
        FEEDBACK: Be careful of the question:  this one asks specifically about physical health.  Make sure your conclusion fits with the essay question.   Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Where you live is quite important and people in charge of housing policy have a duty to remember this.
        FEEDBACK: Apart from the colloquialism (what does 'quite' really mean?), this concluding line is fine, if a little uninspiring.  It's not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: As has been demonstrated, a three-pronged approach to health through public policy has dramatic effects.  Housing is a key part of this approach and if anybody queries the reason why housing policy should always seek to make a contribution towards improving people's physical health, the answer is simple: the contribution actually works.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines have a good ring to them.  Confident and focussed, they leave a good impression.  These lines are the best option on offer here.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Poland's not out of the woods yet. 
        FEEDBACK: The expression 'out of the woods' make this concluding line too colloquial for an academic essay.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Until Poland's organs of regional government achieve independence from central government, further development is not possible.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good, solid concluding line because it leaves the reader with something to think about and a sense of closure.  This line is the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: As has been shown, it is difficult to assess exactly why it has been so difficult for Poland to implement a coherent regional policy.  Perhaps things will be clearer in a few more years.
        FEEDBACK: These are unsatisfactory concluding lines.  Even if a definitive answer is not possible, some conclusions should be drawn.  Not the best option on offer here.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: I think that ethnographers' biggest limitation is understanding other cultures.
        FEEDBACK: This line is too personal (avoid 'I think') and although it makes a statement, feels rather flat.  Not the best option here. 
        ANSWER: The possible limits of anthropological engagement with different cultures and societies?  Understanding.
        FEEDBACK: Including a rhetorical question in your concluding lines smacks of journalism rather than academia.  If you have a statement to make, make it.  Avoid the rhetorical question.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: From all the examples given, one thing is clear:  ethnographers' biggest limitation is not one of engagement with different cultures and societies but one of understanding, and whether it is possible to break through this barrier is highly doubtful.
        FEEDBACK: This is an example of a good concluding line: it does not provide a definitive answer but still says something definite, i.e. that engagement is limited by understanding.  This answers the question set in the essay title and leaves the reader with something positive to think about.  It is the best option here.

        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is a complete sentence.  Sentence 2 is the fragment.

We're left asking 'what is leading to etc.'  This sub-clause does contain a verb - 'delivers' - but this verb is attached  something within the sub-clause.

        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is a complete sentence. Sentence 2 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  The subject of sentence 1 is 'the main way' not 'Labour', so 'the main way' needs a verb of its own, e.g. 'The main way Labour managed to reduce child poverty WAS with its tax and benefit system.'

        Task multiplechoice difficulty 2
INTRO  <font size="4">Which of these three assertions needs evidence (with a reference) to back it up?</font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: The concept of globalisation is complex.  It does not simply mean that the world is one marketplace.
        FEEDBACK: If you have taken the phrase 'one marketplace' from a source, you must acknowledge that source.  If, however, this idea is your own thought, you don't need hard evidence here since this is your opinion.  You will, though, want to prove your point and this will usually involve examples.
        ANSWER: Globalisation has brought with it a new kind of crime, in which international financial institutions are charged with not supporting poor nations to uphold, for example, globally accepted safety standards.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion does need evidence. Appropriate evidence might include the 2002 sinking of the Senegalese ferry, as analysed by Rothe, Muzzatti and Mullins (2006).  
        ANSWER: The western media, with its wide reach, contributes to the sense that we are all connected.
        FEEDBACK: Although telling examples are always helpful, this kind of general assertion does not need specific evidence.  However, if you are paraphrasing lines you found in a source, you must acknowledge the source both in the text and in the bibliography.

INTRO <font size="4">Which of the following assertions need to be backed up by hard evidence?</font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: Factories in Bosnia and Croatia sent weapons to Baghdad just before the US invasion.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion certainly requires evidence.  Examples of the weapons should be given, and the source should be reputable (i.e. not Wikipedia).
        ANSWER: Illegal arms trafficking compromises public safety.
        FEEDBACK: This general assertion is a topic for a paragraph (which would include examples) rather than something that requires immediate hard evidence.
        ANSWER: In 2001, the Serbian authorities found huge amounts of pure heroin in a bank deposit box.
        FEEDBACK: This type of statement is never acceptable in an academic essay.  How much is 'huge'?  We need to know that 600 kg of 93% pure heroin was discovered, with a street value of about $20 million - and this must be properly referenced.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4"><br /></font> 
        ANSWER: The Leeds study revealed that walking trips to the main food store increased after retail intervention.
        FEEDBACK: Evidence is certainly needed here, for example '... walking trips to the main food store increased from 12.3% to 30.8% after retail intervention (Wrigley et al. 2004)'.
        ANSWER: A 'food desert' intervention study in Leeds included focus groups as a major part of its design.
        FEEDBACK: This statement does not need specific evidence, although we need a reference for the study, e.g. (Wrigley et al. 2004).  It is highly likely that evidence from the focus groups would be included in the essay.
        ANSWER: Tesco is increasing its market share as Morrison's share is slipping.
        FEEDBACK: Assertions about figures and statistics always need hard evidence to back them up.  This assertion should be followed by:  According to Kantar Worldpanel (in Daily Telegraph 2010a) December 2010 saw Tesco's market share increase to 30.7% from 30.6% whilst Morrison's dipped from 12.1% to 12%.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: The Irish famine was precipitated by potato blight.
        FEEDBACK: This is a topic sentence, but does not require hard evidence in the same way as, for example, a statement about how many people died in the famine.
        ANSWER: Before famine struck, adult males in Ireland consumed massive numbers of potatoes each day.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention numbers, you must give numbers, not rely on colloquialisms like 'massive'.  A better sentence would be: Before famine struck adult males in Ireland consumed on average 70 potatoes each day. <br />
        ANSWER: In conclusion, it is clear that these are the reasons Scotland avoided the famine which was so disastrous for their neighbours across the Irish sea.
        FEEDBACK: This would be followed by a reference, formatted in the appropriate style (Harvard or footnote system).

INTRO <font size="4">Which of the following assertions need hard evidence to back them up?</font> 
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.
        FEEDBACK: The phrase 'found many ways' clearly indicates a need for evidence.  You cannot say 'many ways' and not produce at least two fully referenced examples of those ways.  You might, for example, say:  Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.  For example, she undermined relations between cabinet colleagues and appropriated the powers of her Chancellor of the Exchequer (Smith in Rhodes & Dunleavy 1995).
        ANSWER: Thatcher became the British prime minister following the 1979 general election.
        FEEDBACK: This is a well known and incontrovertible fact so doesn't need proof.
        ANSWER: In 1979, there was a big percentage swing to the Conservatives and they won many more seats than Labour.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention percentages and numbers, you need to provide exact figures, not just concepts like 'big' or 'more'.  Here, we need to know that the percentage swing was 5.2% and that the Conservatives won 339 seats against Labour's 269 (BBC 1997).

        Task multiplechoice difficulty 1
INTRO <font size="4">At higher levels, the ionic conductivity of the overall electrolyte is reduced, lower levels confer insufficient cubic stability.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 A semi-colon should replace one of the commas in this text.  Which comma?  The one after 'levels' or the one after 'reduced'?
        ANSWER: The comma after 'levels' should be a semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  'At higher levels' is a sub-clause, i.e. it adds information to the main clause.  A comma is the best (and most proper) way to separate a sub-clause from a main clause.
        ANSWER: The comma after 'reduced' should be a semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is a perfect place for a semi-colon.  Remember that a semi-colon is used to divide two complete sentences (i.e. sentences that could stand perfectly well on their own), when the sentences are closely related.  These two sentences, neatly juxtaposing 'higher levels' and 'lower levels', fit the bill exactly.

INTRO <font size="4">This potential technology is seen as a solution to the world's energy problems but is predicated upon two conditions; that the sun continues to supply the earth with quantities of energy and that hydrogen can be produced from water at a sufficient rate. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the semi-colon in this text properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A semi-colon divides two complete sentences that are closely related.  This is not the case here.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A semi-colon divides two complete sentences that are closely related.  Here, the semi-colon is being used to introduce a list, which it is not designed to do. A colon is the correct way to introduce a list.
    QUESTION 1 Is there anywhere else in this text that a semi-colon might be useful?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A semi-colon can also divide items in a list when the items are long.  In this text, it might be useful to put a semi-colon after the first item on the list, i.e. 'quantities of energy;  and that hydrogen etc.' This gives the reader time to take a breath.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A semi-colon can also divide items in a list when the items are long.  In this text, it might be useful to put a semi-colon after the first item on the list, i.e. 'quantities of energy;  and that hydrogen etc.' This gives the reader time to take a breath.

INTRO  <font size="4">But even with increased battery life, these products were not made commercially for several reasons - fuel cell electronic devices are just too expensive to compete with lithium ion batteries; and the methanol used to fuel them is toxic.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 The dash in this text should be replaced.  Which is the right replacement, a colon or a semi-colon?
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A colon should be used to introduce a list, and the phrase 'for several reasons' shows there is a list coming.  A semi-colon can separate items in a list, or separate two complete sentences that are closely connected.
        ANSWER: A semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again!

INTRO <font size="4">There is no single answer to polymorphism each example requires a fresh approach.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 We need some punctuation in this sentence.  What do we need?
        ANSWER: A comma.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We've two strong clauses so we need something stronger than a comma.  With a comma, the text reads like a 'run-on' sentence, i.e. two sentences that have not been divided properly.
        ANSWER: A semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: You could put a semi-colon after 'polymorphism'.  You would then have two complete and related sentences with a pause between them.  That would work.  I don't, however, think that's the best punctuation here.
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think we need a colon after 'polymorphism'.  A colon can stand for 'that is', which makes sense in this context, i.e. There is no one answer to polymorphism:  (that is) each example requires a fresh approach.

INTRO <font size="4">In Altzheimer's patients, there is a shortage of acetylcholine, the acetylcholine esterase receptor breaks down even more acetylcholine which means the brain is not able to replenish the acetylcholine lost.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Would the comma in this sentence best be left as it is, replaced by a semi-colon, or replaced by a colon?
        ANSWER: Left as it is.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  There needs to be a harder pause, as it were, between the two pieces of information offered.  They don't flow together naturally.
        ANSWER: Replaced by a semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: This is an option, since we have two complete sentences closely related.  However, I don't think it's the best option.
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The second part of the sentence (beginning 'The acetylcholine esterase') expands on the first part, so a colon is the most appropriate form of punctuation here.

INTRO <font size="4">Tacrine has more serious side effect, a possible increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT).</font> 
    QUESTION 0 What might best replace the comma in this text?
        ANSWER: Nothing:  the comma is fine.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: A semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  When the second part of a sentence expands on the first, a colon is the most appropriate punctuation.  It is really standing in for 'that is to say' or introducing a particular example of a point made in the first part of the sentence.
        Task multiplechoice difficulty 3
INTRO <font size="4">It is a proinflammatory cytokine; inducing inflammation.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the semi-colon properly used here?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A semi-colon separates two complete sentences that are closely related.  'Inducing inflammation' is not a complete sentence because it has no driving verb, so a semi-colon is not appropriate here.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A semi-colon separates two complete sentences that are closely related.  'Inducing inflammation' is not a complete sentence because it has no driving verb, so a semi-colon is not appropriate here.
    QUESTION 1 If you feel the semi-colon is not properly used, what would you replace it with? 
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A colon introduces a list, or stands in for 'that is', i.e. an expansion on a point already made.  In the example text, 'inducing inflammation' is part of the initial point, not an expansion of the point.
        ANSWER: A full stop.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  'It is proinflammatory cytokine' is a complete sentence and could end with a full stop.  However, 'inducing inflammation' is a sentence fragment, i.e. it has no driving verb.  A full stop, therefore, would not help.
        ANSWER: A comma.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A comma allows the reader to take a breath but the information flows together, which make much more sense.

INTRO  <font size="4">Other treatments for the side effects include: anti-depressants, sedating anti-psychotic drugs and non-sedating anti-psychotic drugs.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the colon correctly used in this text?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It introduces a list.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  There is a list in this text, but the list flows from the text, so the colon interrupts.  A colon only introduces a list that is flagged up as a list, e.g. There are three other treatments:  anti-depressants; sedating antipsychotic drugs; and non-sedating antipsychotic drugs.
        ANSWER: No.  The type of list in this text doesn't need to be introduced by a colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A colon only introduces a list that is flagged up as a list, e.g. There are three other treatments:  anti-depressants; sedating antipsychotic drugs; and non-sedating antipsychotic drugs.

    QUESTION 0 Why is this text in the 'commas and run-on' sentence category?
        ANSWER: It's too long.
        FEEDBACK: It is long, certainly, but that's not the main reason.
        ANSWER: The commas should be semi-colons.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not the reason.  Semi-colons would not be appropriate.
        ANSWER: The text contains too many pieces of information for one sentence.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  For clarity, information needs to be divided into sentences.  If you pile too much information into one sentence, the reader is inclined to lose track.  If a reader loses track, I'm afraid it's usually the writer's fault, not the reader's.
    QUESTION 1 How many pieces of information are in this text?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: Really?  Read it again.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: Not 2.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 3.
        FEEDBACK: Not 3.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 4.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  Read the text slowly.  There are four pieces of information.  In this particular text, it would be far better if each had its own sentence.  Sentence 1 "The basic principle ... cathode".  Sentence 2 "The ionic potential ... electrolyte."  Sentence 3  "The O2-ions ...2e-."  Sentence 4 "As the electrolyte ... more oxygen."

INTRO <font size="4">He deduced that this functioning of the cell could be optimised to produce a 'notable surface of action' between each phase of the cell - electrode, electrolyte and gaseous fuel molecules, and by arranging many cells in series.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the dash in this text properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, I'm afraid it's not.  Try the next question.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  Go to the next question.
    QUESTION 1 If you feel that the dash is not properly used, can you choose which of the following would solve the problem?
        ANSWER: Placing a corresponding dash after 'molecules' so that the sentence is better balanced.
        FEEDBACK: This is certainly an option.   If you are using dashes to enclose a piece of information within a long sentence, make sure you use both an opening dash and a closing dash. 
        ANSWER: Replace the dash with a comma.
        FEEDBACK: In some texts that would work.  In this particular text, it wouldn't work.  A comma would encourage the reader to think that 'electrode, electrolyte and gaseous fuel molecules' are part of the list of 'notable surfaces of action' when in fact, 'electrode, electrolyte and gaseous fuel molecules' refers to phases of the cell.  This is why punctuation is important: it can actually change the meaning of your text.

    QUESTION 0 How many dashes are included in this text?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 3.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  The line in make-up is a hyphen, not a dash.
        ANSWER: 4.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 What would be a good replacement for the first dash (between 'popular' and 'disease')?
        ANSWER: A full stop.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This would create two concise, informative sentences.
        ANSWER: A semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: This would work perfectly well, dividing two complete but closely connected sentences.
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: A colon should introduce a list, or stand in for 'that is' (i.e. expanding on the previous clause).  In this text, it's the theories that are listed, not the causes of the disease, so a colon is not appropriate.
    QUESTION 2 What would be a good replacement for the dashes on either side of 'at the moment'?
        ANSWER: No punctuation is necessary here at all.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It's true that the text makes sense with no punctuation, but for the sake of the reader, a sub-clause like 'at the moment' reads more easily with some punctuation.
        ANSWER: A pair of commas in place of the dashes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A sub-clause should be enclosed in a pair of commas.  This is much more reader-friendly.  Dashes are much too heavy-handed, unless a very particular emphasis is sought.
        ANSWER: No need to replace.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.

    QUESTION 0 In which of these sentences are the dashes used correctly?  Sentence 1 or sentence 2?
1.  Polymorphs are molecules with the same chemical composition - that are able to crystallize in more than one form.
2. The carbonate groups form flat triangles - C is in the middle - and these groups are perpendicular to the C axis.
        ANSWER: Sentence 1 uses dashes correctly.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree about the correct use of dashes in this sentence, though I do agree we need some form of punctuation.  I'd go for a colon so that the sentence reads 'Polymorphs are molecules with the same chemical composition:  they are able to crystallize in more than one form.'  A colon here stands in for 'that is', i.e. what comes after the colon expands on what goes before.  In the example text, the dash has been used to disguise the fact that the sentence doesn't flow properly.

    QUESTION 0 Dashes and commas are interchangeable.  
        ANSWER: Correct.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A pair of dashes emphatically encloses information that's explanatory and necessary to a full understanding of a fact or facts in a sentence.  Commas mark off sub-clauses.  Sub-clauses add information but without the emphasis of dashes.
        ANSWER: Incorrect.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A pair of dashes emphatically encloses information that's explanatory and necessary to a full understanding of a fact or facts in a sentence.  Commas mark off sub-clauses.  Sub-clauses add information but without the emphasis of dashes.
    QUESTION 1 In which of the following sentences are dashes used correctly?  
1. Famous historical figures - such as Sir Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud - suffered from depression.
2. Exploration of mechanisms used by other members of the series - namely, carboxypeptidase A - allowed research to progress.  
        ANSWER: Sentence 1 uses dashes correctly.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We don't need any punctuation before 'such as'.  The names of the historical figures are not necessary to understand the sense of the sentence:  they are simply examples.  The sentence flows well with just commas separating the names.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2 uses dashes correctly.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The dashes in this sentence create just the right pause and emphasis around the example to help the reader follow the meaning of the sentence.  They could be exchanged for commas, but dashes don't interfere here, as they do in sentence 1.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. 'By definition' is not an essential piece of information, or a piece of information that requires special emphasis.  Commas would be more appropriate.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It could certainly be argued that, in this context, 'collectively known as ageing' should have special emphasis, since the writer is underlining the processes of ageing, rather than just the general idea of ageing.

INTRO <font size="4">The structure is stabilised in the cubic form at room temperature by doping with Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at about 8 mo1%. At higher levels the ionic conductivity of the overall electrolyte is reduced; lower levels confer insufficient cubic stability. Yttria is a good dopant because it is cheap, chemically stable under the operating conditions of the cell and in contact with the other components of the cell.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Go to the next question.
        ANSWER: 4.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 Where should it be divided?
        ANSWER: It should be divided after 'cubic stability' so that 'Yttria' starts a new paragraph, and again after 'coefficient to the electrolyte' so that 'These parameters' starts a new paragraph. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Yttria is connected to the 'doping' mentioned in the first sentence, so belongs in that same paragraph.  'The parameters' refers to the description of the parameters in the previous sentence, so these sentences belong in the same paragraph.  
        ANSWER: There should be only one paragraph break and it should come after 'components of the cell' so that 'The anode' starts a new paragraph.  The text will then be two distinct paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The first paragraph's subject is stabilisation and doping;  the second paragraph's subject is the anode.

    QUESTION 0 This text should be split into two paragraphs.  Where should the new paragraph begin?
        ANSWER: At sentence two, with 'Metal hydrides ...'
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Metal hydrides are mentioned in the previous sentence, so it makes sense in this context for there to be no paragraph break here.
        ANSWER: 'Toyota' should begin a new paragraph, since this is a new subject.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Toyota is mentioned in the context of hydrides, so it is not a new subject and doesn't need a new paragraph.
        ANSWER: 'Another metal' should begin a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.   The topic of hydrides is finished, and the essay is moving on to palladium.  This needs a new paragraph.

Glaxo continued marketing Zantac but was subject to further litigation because of lack of legal clarity. The legalities surrounding ranitidine demonstrate that polymorphism is not yet fully understood and that pharmaceutical companies are inclined to take advantage of the uncertainties. Disappearing polymorphs, polymorph stability and seeding show how complex polymorphs are.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should there be a paragraph break somewhere in this text?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.
    QUESTION 1 If you think there should be a new paragraph, where should it be?
        ANSWER: 'Glaxo continued marketing' etc. should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Glaxo is the focus of the previous sentence, so they should be kept together.
        ANSWER: 'The legalities surrounding' etc. should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This sentence moves the essay on from the particular - Glaxo - to the general.
        ANSWER: 'Disappearing polymorphs' etc. should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence is illustrating the legal difficulties so should be kept in the same paragraph as 'the legalities'.

INTRO  <font size="4">The formation of amyloid beta through cleavage requires extracellular cleavage at different points and also additional cleavage inside the membrane of the precursor protein. These plaques tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic. They also form an abnormal protein coating on nerve cells. Amyloid beta is thought to be the main cause of neuro-degeneration. Tangles are associated with a protein known as Tau. They are formed by the hyper-phosphorylation of a microtubule associated with this protein.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should this text be divided into paragraphs, and if so, how many?
        ANSWER: It's fine as one paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: It should be two paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Try the next question.
        ANSWER: It should be three paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 If you think there should be a division, or divisions, where should it (they) be?
        ANSWER: New paragraphs are needed for 'They also form' and 'Amyloid beta'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These sentences are all connected to amyloid beta, so need to stay together.
        ANSWER: New paragraphs are needed for 'These plaques' and 'Tangles'.
        FEEDBACK: Half right, I'd say, in that we need a new paragraph for 'Tangles', which begins a new topic, but not for 'These plaques' which is a continuation of the existing topic.
        ANSWER: New paragraph needed for 'Tangles'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is a new topic, so needs a new paragraph.

INTRO <font size="4">Oxidative stress causes damage in the body, most significantly to DNA. In view of the accumulated evidence in support of the role oxidative stress plays in the ageing process and disease, it seems safe to assume that it does contribute to these processes, though to what degree is uncertain. Radicals have also been shown to be an important component of signal transduction. They also play a vital role in pathogen eradication. This suggests that although damaging, they are a necessary part of a healthy body's metabolism.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 In this text, where should the paragraph break come?
        ANSWER: 'In view of the accumulated evidence' should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence is linked to oxidative stress, so needs to flow on in the same paragraph.
        ANSWER: 'Radicals have also been shown' should begin a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  We've now moved on from oxidative stress to a new topic.
        ANSWER: 'They also play a vital role' should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence continues with a topic, so does not need to start a new paragraph.

INTRO <font size="4">Nanotechnology derives from many science disciplines and has a diverse array of applications in modern life. Nanomedicine, in particular, has many current research prospects involving drug delivery, gene therapy and the detection and treatment of cancer. There are two main methods of assembling nano-sized materials and devices: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down involves reducing the dimensions of large-scale designs to a minimum of ~10nm. Bottom-up uses atoms or molecules as building blocks to construct complex nanostructures, achieving smaller dimensions of between 2 and 10nm.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should this text be divided into two paragraphs?  If so, where should the division occur?
        ANSWER: 'Nanomedicine' should start a new paragraph as this is a new topic.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Nanomedicine, in this context, is a particular illustration of the wider topic, nanotechnology.
        ANSWER: 'There are two main methods' should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This passage is about assembly, so should begin a new paragraph.
        ANSWER: The text is fine as one paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the assembly part needs a new paragraph so that the reader knows this is a new (although obviously related) topic.

A more rigid shape was constructed through the use of DNS double crossover (DX) junctions, a characteristic developed from genetic processes. By manipulating the DX sticky ends, a variety of 'tiles' can be made, which then self-assemble bottom-up into a multitude of DNA arrays.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should this text be divided into two paragraphs, and if so, where?
        ANSWER: The text should be two paragraphs, with the second starting with 'By manipulating the DX sticky ends'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This information flows on from the DNA branched junctions, and should not be separated by a paragraph break.
        ANSWER: The text should be two paragraph, with the second starting 'A more rigid shape'.  
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is all part of the DNA branched junction topic.
        ANSWER: The text is fine as one paragraph.

Attachment via side chain functional groups is also possible, most notably with peptides containing aspartic acid or glutamic acid as the C-terminal residue.<sup>14</sup> </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should this text be two paragraphs, and if so, where should the division occur?
        ANSWER: This text is fine as one paragraph since it's all about one topic. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think there are two distinct topics here.
        ANSWER: The text should be two paragraphs, with the second beginning 'Attachment via side chain'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think 'attachment' is a new topic, albeit related, so, for clarity, needs a new paragraph.
        ANSWER: The text should be three paragraphs: the second starting 'This reference amino acid';  and the third starting 'Attachment via side chain'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree about three paragraphs.  I think it should be two, with the second starting 'Attachment via side chain'.  'This reference amino acid' belongs with the first sentence.  They are both focused on the same topic.

    QUESTION 0 Which is the fragment, the first sentence or the second?
        ANSWER: The first.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  The first sentence has a driving verb - 'is'.  This sets the sentence in time, i.e. the present.  It's a whole sentence.
        ANSWER: The second.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  This phrase is a sub-clause, not a whole sentence.  The phrase 'as well as' shows us that it needs another thought to make a complete sentence, or we're left asking 'as well as what?'  The verb 'would make' only applies to the sub-clause;  it does not drive the sentence.

    QUESTION 0 Which sentence is a complete sentence, and which is a sentence fragment?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is a complete sentence;  sentence 2 is a fragment.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Sentence 1 is a sub-clause.  The give-away is that it starts with 'while'. 'While' usually indicates added information, so nearly always heralds a sub-clause.  Sentence 2 has a subject, 'different solvents', and a main verb, 'were tried'.  A complete sentence must have a subject and a main verb.

INTRO <font size="4">Reactive and endogenous describes the trigger of depression, reactive describe an environmentally stimulus such as bereavement, endogenous describe a trigger more seated in physiology.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Are 'describes', 'describe' and 'describe' (see the text for context) all used properly in this sentence?  You can choose more than one option.
        ANSWER: Yes.  They're all grammatically correct.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.   Try again.
        ANSWER: The first two - 'describes' and 'describe' are the wrong way round.  We need 'describes' first, then 'describe'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Reactive and endogenous are two different things, so need the plural, i.e. 'reactive and endogenous describe'.  'Reactive' on its own is singular, so needs the singular 'reactive describes'.
        ANSWER: The final 'describe' is correct.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The final 'describe' is plural, when 'endogenous' is singular.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The text should read 'endogenous describes ...'
    QUESTION 1 There are two commas in this text.  What might be good replacements?
        ANSWER: Nothing:  the commas are well used where they are.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence, with its commas, makes for a run-on sentence, i.e. one sentence that should be broken up.  Try again.
        ANSWER: We need two colons:  one after 'trigger of depression' and one after 'bereavement'.
        FEEDBACK: Half right.  I think a colon after 'trigger of depression' would be useful, but I think we need something stronger than a comma after 'bereavement'.
        ANSWER: We need a colon and a semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  We need a colon after 'trigger of depression', since the information that follows expands on the first bit of the sentence.  A semi-colon would nicely divide the two topic items, 'reactive' and 'endogenous'.

    QUESTION 0 There is a word improperly used in this text.  Which is it?
        ANSWER: polarization
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  That seems correct here.
        ANSWER: affect
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  'Effect' is the correct noun here.  An effect is a result.
        ANSWER: polarizability
        FEEDBACK: This is quite a word, I agree, but though it's clumsy, it makes sense in this context.
    QUESTION 1 One character in the equation is wrongly formatted.  Which is it?
        ANSWER: P
        FEEDBACK: Not P.  Try again.
        ANSWER: =
        FEEDBACK: No, not =.  Try again.
        ANSWER: @
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This should be an alpha, not an ampersand.
    QUESTION 2 Is this text written in active or passive mode?
        ANSWER: Active.
        FEEDBACK: It is.  'I will use' signifies the active mode.  However, academic texts should use the more impersonal passive mode.  Better to say 'the equation etc. was used'.
        ANSWER: Passive.
        FEEDBACK: It is actually written in the active mode - I will use -  though the more impersonal passive mode is correct in an academic essay.   Better to say 'the equation etc. was used'.
    QUESTION 3 Should well known be hyphenated?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It is usually hyphenated as it has come to be almost one word.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Well-known is usually hyphenated since it has almost turned into one word.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: Most things matter!  Well-known should be hyphenated, as it has become almost one word.  It is muddling to read if it's not hyphenated.
    QUESTION 4 There's a singular/plural mismatch in this text.  Where is it?
        ANSWER: polarization of the material
        FEEDBACK: No.  Try again.
        ANSWER: an electric fields
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Be careful!  Your reader doesn't know if this is simply a typo or a real grammatical error. Don't make them choose.

        FEEDBACK: Yes, quite right.  Don't contract in an academic essay.  Use 'it is'.
        ANSWER: a problem that dogs
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I might say to you 'I'm dogged by depression', but in an essay it's better to use a more formal expression.  'a problem that affects' would be fine.
        ANSWER: lots of
        FEEDBACK: Yes.  This colloquialism crops up again and again in academic essays.  Apart from being too chatty, 'lots of' is extremely imprecise.  How many is 'lots of'?  You need a precise statistic, properly referenced.  'Lots of' smacks of slapdash research.
        ANSWER: different age-groups
        FEEDBACK: I'd say this was fine for an academic essay.
        ANSWER: massive number
        FEEDBACK: Yes, this is a colloquialism of the same sort at 'lots of'.  Apart from being too chatty, it's much too vague.  You need a statistic, properly referenced.
        ANSWER: GP
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Your reader might not know what GP stands for.   Write out General Practitioner in full, with (GP) afterwards so that you can use the initials later in the essay.
        ANSWER: over the years
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Again, as with so many colloquialisms, this is too general.  Use a statistic, properly referenced.
        ANSWER: looming ever larger
        FEEDBACK: Yes, this is another colloquialism.  'Increasing' would be quite enough in the example text, and would sound more professional.

        ANSWER: With the advent of quantum mechanics in the early half of the 20th century, the question of how to describe systems with multiple electrons (the so-called 'many electron problem') was addressed with reasonable success by E. Fermi and L. Thomas with their subsequently named Thomas-Fermi theory (TFT).
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is informative, but has three faults: it's too long for an opening line;  it doesn't arrest the reader's attention; and it does not grasp the essay topic firmly.  It is leading up to the topic, but a strong opening line will actually address the topic.   Not the best option. 
        ANSWER: The history of density functional theorem (DFT) is still being made, yet since it is the way forward for quantum calculations, a review of its development reveals much about both its current status and future possibilties.
        FEEDBACK: I like this opening line.  It may be long, but it grasps the topic and tell us why the essay is going to be both interesting and informative.  This is the best choice on offer.
        ANSWER: Density functional theory (DFT) is 'a quantum mechanical modelling method used in physics and chemistry to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems' (Wikipedia).
        FEEDBACK: Definitions are all very well but quoting from Wikipedia is not acceptable in an academic essay.  Wikipedia is not a reliable source. If you must start your essay with a definition rather than a thought, then find a reputable source from which to quote.   This is a very poor option.

This essay will explore the practical synthesis for each of the three compounds, since economical and efficient synthetic processing will  enhance HIV treatment and save lives.

        ANSWER: The HIV virus specifically targets cells of the immune system such as helper T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, all of which have CD4 proteins on their surface.  By targeting these cells, the AIDS virus either kills the cells or disrupts their function.
        FEEDBACK: These lines might well appear in the body of the essay, but they are too detailed for opening lines.  They read like the middle of something, not the start.  They might well leave the reader slightly at sea and checking the essay title to see what the essay is actually about.  Not a good option.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />The Asymmetric Epoxidation of Allylic Alcohols.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose the best opening line(s) for your introduction. All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice is also ours, it might be worth scanning through the rest and reading the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: Epoxidation is a vital transformation in organic synthesis.  The process produces important reactive species that find use as synthetic intermediates or, less often, as products in their own right, e.g. epichlorohydrin, a common compound found in epoxy resin.  Allylic describes an alcohol in which the hydroxyl group is bonded to an allylic carbon atom or a benzylic carbon atom.1
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines are clear, confident and informative.  They refer directly to the essay title and grasp the reader's attention by sounding authoritative.    These are strong opening lines, and the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: This essay is going to discuss the asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols.  It will explore the history and uses of asymmetric epoxidation and examine what processes this involves.  This essay will also look at new research in this area.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines are very weak.  It's certainly good to include terms from the essay title in opening lines, but you must add something to them, not just repeat them.  These lines are really just waffle disguised as an essay map.  An essay map needs more than vague indications of an essay's direction.  These lines could apply to almost any essay. They could also be left out without losing anything from the essay.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: Like many organic reactions, transition states play a crucial role in determining selectivity, be it regio- or stereoselectivity.  Epoxidations are no different:  their stereoselectivity is dependent on cyclic transition states.
        FEEDBACK: These lines might be a good start to a background section of an essay, but they don't work well at the start of your introduction.   An introduction needs to draw the reader in by explaining terms and providing an essay map.  These lines presume that we are already bedded into the essay.  Not the best option on offer for an introduction.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Antibiotics and the Development of New Compounds to Target Bacterial Resistance.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose the best opening line(s) for your introduction. All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice is also ours, it might be worth scanning through the rest and reading the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: The threat of bacterial infection is one that has been affecting humans since long before ideas of medicinal chemistry were in circulation.  Bacterial infections still cause many deaths each year;  for example C Diff was a factor in 597 deaths in Scotland in 2008 compared with 313 deaths in 2005.1 
        FEEDBACK: Though the first sentence in this introduction might do for a newspaper article, it is too general for an academic essay, particularly for an essay supposedly focused on bacterial resistance rather than bacterial infection.  In addition, the reference to C diff is not explained and the figure used is at least three years old.  This means that instead of enhancing the essay, the reference diminishes it.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Perhaps the biggest development in antibiotics came in 1929 when Alexander Fleming noted that a penicillium mould contaminant could cause the lysis of colonies of staphylococci.   This led to the first successful chemotherapeutic agent produced by a microbe.
        FEEDBACK: If you start your essay with 'perhaps', you have already weakened it.  Always start with a confident statement.  The rest of these lines would be better in a 'background' section.  Your introduction needs to define your terms and also provide an essay map.  These lines do neither. 
        ANSWER: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics 
        FEEDBACK: These lines form a strong opening.  They tell us why the topic is important and outline the essay's specific focus.  If, after reading them, somebody asked the reader 'what's the essay about?', the reader would be able to answer without hesitation.  These are the best opening lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: threatens to undermine man's ability to tackle the infectious diseases it was hoped antibiotics might eradicate. New compounds to target bacterial resistance are being developed and this essay will focus on two specific classes of antibiotic:  beta-lactams and macrolides.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Polymorphism.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose the best opening line(s) for your introduction. All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice is also ours, it might be worth scanning through the rest and reading the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: 'Every compound has different polymorphic forms and, in general, the number of forms known for a given compound is proportional to the time and money spent in research on that compound.'  Walter C. McCrone
        FEEDBACK: Starting an essay with a quotation is often an excellent way of grabbing the reader's attention.  It must, however, be a relevant quote.  I'd say this quote was entirely relevant, and so long as the writer went on to define polymorphism more specifically, and also to define the areas the essay was going to cover, I'd say this was a good opening to an introduction.  I still prefer one of the other options here, but I wouldn't write this one off.  N.B.  If you quote, remember to reference correctly.
        ANSWER: Polymorphism is a phenomenon with far-reaching implications in many fields of chemistry.  It is a vital consideration in drug discovery which is why it has been chosen as the subject for this essay.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are a little waffly.  A strong introduction needs more precision.  We need an example or two of the fields of chemistry, and one reason why polymorphism is a vital consideration in drug discovery.   There is a difference between too much detail in introductory sentences and too little.  This example offers too little.  Not a good option.
        ANSWER: Polymorphism is a phenomenon with far-reaching implications in many fields of chemistry, particularly crystallography and solid state chemistry.  It is also a vital consideration in drug discovery since different polymorphs can have different chemical and physical properties, often resulting in different effects on the user.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines draw the reader in and, through offering examples, move the reader effortlessly from the general to the specific.  These are the best opening lines on offer in this exercise.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Fuel Cells: Current Technology and some Directions of Research.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose the best opening line(s) for your introduction. All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice is also ours, it might be worth scanning through the rest and reading the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: With the end of oil being well in sight and popular, scientific and governmental awareness and opinion being largely united over climate change, energy security and sustainability, much effort is currently being spent on developing new and existing environmentally friendly or alternative energy technologies with ever greater degrees of efficiency and one such technology, which is the focus of a lot of research, is fuel cell technology.
        FEEDBACK: I feel quite breathless after reading this.  It contains good ideas but needs breaking up.  The tone is also too chatty - 'well in sight' and 'a lot of' are colloquialisms.  We also need references for all these assertions.   This is enthusiastic, but needs to be refined to score good marks in an academic essay.  Not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: The importance of developing fuel cell technology has increased in line with increasing global worries about climate change, energy security and environmental sustainability.1  This essay will look at current technologies, for example proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).  It will then examine how, with industry now interested in fuel cell research, the new technologies are being funded and whether the hopes pinned on them are likely to lead to a fundamental change in the way we produce and use energy.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines provide a neat way into the essay.  They move from the general - current technologies - to the specific - the two examples.  This is very good practice.  These lines also provide a clear essay map.   They inspire confidence in the reader.  These are the best option on offer here. 
        ANSWER: The goal of meeting the energy needs of the planet with renewable ecologically sound technologies is mired in economic complications.  These provide obstacles to the more rapid advance of developing technologies, whose goal is to provide a fully environmentally friendly, sustainable hydrogen economy.  This essay will provide a history of the fuel cell to show how it came to develop and what it might, in the future, contribute to this goal.
        FEEDBACK: It's two sentences before we get to the fuel cell, and the title very clearly states 'current technology' not 'the history of'.  Be careful to look your title and not to wander off course right at the start.  Also, to strengthen the assertions made about economic complications and developing technologies, we need at least one example which will be developed further into the essay.  These lines are not the best option on offer.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose the best opening line(s) for your introduction. All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice is also ours, it might be worth scanning through the rest and reading the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: Robert Bruce Merrifield, who died in 2006, was the inventor of solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).  Although his invention did not win him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry until 1984, he came up with the idea of SPPS in 1959.  SPPS was important because it was hoped that it might eliminate, or at least reduce, one of the biggest problems facing peptide synthesis to that date, namely the isolation and purification of the peptide from the liquid phase.
        FEEDBACK: The title of this essay gives no indication of its scope or point.  Take care with such titles, and with opening lines like these ones.  They read well but they don't actually lead anywhere.  By the end, the reader still has no idea of the point or scope of the essay.  If you choose an open title such as this one, your opening lines must convince the reader that the essay isn't just going to be a wander around solid phase peptide synthesis, but has something particular to discuss.  These lines are not the best option on offer.
        ANSWER: Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) has produced peptides used to study the structure and activity of various biological molecules such as Bovine Pancreatic Robonuclease A7 and HIV-1 protease.1  From these, a number of peptide analogues, mainly small organic molecules to avoid the problem of low bio-availability, have been synthesised. 
        FEEDBACK: As opening lines, these lines don't work because they introduce, without definition or explanation, too many different terms.  Your introduction must do what the section title suggests, i.e. introduce.   These lines may belong in the essay, but they don't belong right at the start.
        ANSWER: Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) creates peptides (short polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds) and proteins in a synthetic manner.1  This essay will chart a brief history of SPPS;  assess its advantages;  provide a detailed overview of chemical reactions SPPS produces; and finally, assess the likelihood of  biotechnology replacing the chemical synthesis of peptides some time in the future.
        FEEDBACK: These lines provide a definition of solid phase peptide synthesis and an essay plan.  The plan is crucial when you have such a general heading as this one.  The reader needs to feel confident that the writer isn't just going to ramble.  These lines are the best option of those on offer.

INTRO  <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Using organometallics as an example, does conjugate addition deserve its status as one of the most important reactions in chemistry?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose the best concluding line(s). All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice is also ours, it might be worth scanning through the rest and reading the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: In conclusion, conjugate addition of organometallics is a very effective way of forming new C-C bonds.  As this essay has shown, by altering the conditions of the reaction, using additives and employing chiral ligands, a high degree of regioselectivity and enantioselectivity can be achieved.  As has also been shown, recent research into reagents could provide useful new transformations.  Thus, using organometallic nucleophiles as an example, it is clear that conjugate addition deserves its status as one of the most important reactions in chemistry.  
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines follow the essay through, and answer the question the essay writer set.  They are the best concluding lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, the first example of a conjugate addition was reported in 1883 by Komnenos.  However, in 2011, it still has a wide range of applications in synthetic organic chemistry.
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines are very weak.  The essay title asks a question, which these lines do not answer.  Instead they seem to belong to a different essay.  If your title asks a question, use your conclusion to answer it boldly.  After all, you have your whole essay to back up your answer.  Giving a bold and clear answer is a very attractive and satisfying way of drawing a questioning essay to a close.  These lines are not the best option here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, I think I have shown that by altering the conditions of the reaction, using additives and employing chiral ligands, a high degree of regioselectivity and enantioselectivity can be achieved.  As I've also shown, recent research into reagents could provide useful new transformations.  All of this means that, using organometallic nucleophiles as an example, I can state with some confidence that conjugate addition deserves its status as one of the most important reactions in chemistry.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion contains the same information as choice 1, but its tone is too personal.  You must retain the academic tone right to the very last word.  These lines are not the best option on offer.

        ANSWER: Thus, when talking about nonlinear optics, one must be very careful not to think of it being confined to physics for it has some very important chemical applications as well.
        FEEDBACK: With general titles such as this, it is even more important that the essay should stick to a clear path.  It would be hard, from this closing line, to know what the essay had been about, and for that reason I'd say it was a weak conclusion.  Not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Thus it can be argued that organic crystals are the materials offering the best prospects for research into second phase harmonic generation, and the prospects are exciting.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line clearly connects with the title of the essay, and offers a strong conclusion.  This is the best option on offer.
        ANSWER: It has only been within the past few decades that nonlinear optics has been studied properly, the key date being the invention of the commercial laser in 1961.  However, study has come a long way since then and promises to go further in the future.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too general - as though the essay has run out of steam.  Make sure your concluding lines remain focused tightly on the subject of your essay.  Remember, last impressions really do count.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: As has been shown, depression is a term coined for a wide spectrum of illnesses, many of which require different treatments.  However, with the advances from MAOIs to tricyclic MARIs to atypical MARIs and the advent of more effective drugs with fewer side-effects, sufferers have a better chance now than ever before of some relief.
        FEEDBACK: The essay title was 'an overview' and these lines draw an 'overview' nicely to a close.  Examples remind the reader of what was in the body of the text and keep the conclusion from wandering.   These are the best lines on offer.
        ANSWER: Masses of money is spent researching depression and hopefully this means it won't stay a mystery much longer and that soon, better medication will help sufferers lead more normal lives with brighter futures.
        FEEDBACK: These lines read more like a magazine article than an academic essay.  Take care with the tone of your final lines.  It's easy to relax before you've quite got to the end!  The last lines must retain the academic tone and not drift off into banalities and generalities.  This option is not the best on offer.
        ANSWER: 
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line leave the reader turning the page, wondering if the conclusion has been deleted by mistake.  Your ending must obviously be an ending.  Don't leave the reader hanging in mid air.  This is not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Fuel cells are the future.
        FEEDBACK: Short, crisp sentences often make snappy final lines, and so long as the text has led up to a bold final statement, the line should be fine. Beware, however, of making your ending too abrupt - as though you had just run out of things to say.  In short, this line might be fine in its context but I hesitate to say it's the best option here. 
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, fuel cells have attracted interest and investment because of their capacity to prolong battery life for days rather than hours.  In addition, the prospect of instant recharging overcomes what might have been a major difficulty.  
        FEEDBACK: These lines are fine in themselves but it's not clear that they are final lines.  Your reader needs to feel a sense of closure at the end, not be left hanging on, wondering if they've reached the end or not.   These lines have qualities but are not the best option on offer. 
        ANSWER: Despite the drawbacks discussed, this essay has shown that fuel cells have attracted interest and investment.  This is partly because of their capacity to prolong battery life for days rather than hours and partly because the prospect of instant recharging overcomes what might have been a major difficulty.  These two factors alone ensure that fuel cells have secured their place in all our energy debates and will play a big part in our future.

        ANSWER: In this essay I have discussed various ways in which the malarial parasite is being targeted and new methods of treatment which will hopefully be successful in decreasing malaria transmission.
        FEEDBACK: These words don't really read like a conclusion:  they are too bland.  It's not enough to state 'I've done this or that'.  Apart from being too personal (try not to use 'I' in an academic essay), such a statement is a statement of the obvious.  You need to add something to your concluding lines so that the reader is left with something to remember.  This is not the best option offered here. 
        ANSWER: In recent years, it is reported that fake medicines have been sold in south-east Asia and Africa.  These can prove fatal and stopping this unacceptable practice is yet another priority for the World Health Organisation.  For the moment Artemisinin Combination Therapies described earlier seem the most promising way forward and production methods are continually being improved.
        FEEDBACK: This is an example of a thought being parachuted into a conclusion.  Fake medicines cannot simply be dropped in to the conclusion from nowhere.  The last line then reads as though it's been tagged on.  If you suddenly think of another topic, you must insert it into the body of your essay, and also mention it in your introduction.   The parachuted topic means that despite what might have been a good closing line, this option is not the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Notwithstanding the research outlined in this essay, the fight against malaria is not yet won.  The difficulty in finding an effective anti-malaria compound and continued debate about the ideal target of a vaccine means that anti-malarial drugs are still a live and contentious issue.  For the moment, Artemisinin Combination Therapies are the most promising way forward, and with production methods continually improving, may offer the best hope for the future.
        FEEDBACK: These lines neatly wrap up the subject and provide a nice feeling of closure.  If a reader were to be asked 'what was the essay about', they would be able to answer without saying 'er, I'm not really sure'.  This is the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Strychnine is a toxic alkaloid used as a pesticide.  It is added to heroin for the same reason as quinine, since strychnine is one of the bitterest substances known.  Strychnine poisoning causes massive convulsions and death by asphyxiation or exhaustion.
        FEEDBACK: This is a strange ending, and leaves the reader turning page wondering if the conclusion has been left out, or whether they've strayed into the appendices by mistake.   Not a good option.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, many of the opiates derived from poppy seeds have found medicinal applications, principally as pain killers.  However, heroin has proven to be so addictive that pharmacological applications have been ruled out.
        FEEDBACK: This is a dull ending.  Not only that, it doesn't refer to any themes that might have been in the essay.   Your ending needs to acknowledge themes in the essay and move to a conclusion that is both authoritative and satisfying.   You'll have done such a lot of work on your essay.  Don't let it end on a damp squib.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, the chemistry of heroin addiction means that all early hopes of pharmacological applications have now been ruled out.  As has been shown, the biological effects, the withdrawal difficulties and the dangers posed by adulterants all conspire to make heroin highly problematic.  Unfortunately, as has also been shown, chemical adulteration cannot solve the problem of heroin addiction, and other ways of dealing with this blight must be sought.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion refers back to the essay themes and draws a genuine  conclusion.  That is a big plus point.  In addition, even if you only read this paragraph, you'd know what the essay had been about.  That's the mark of a good conclusion.  This is the best option of those on offer.

        ANSWER: Although, as has been shown, PD models have offered great insights into the potential causes of the disease, and have been a strong basis for drug development, research is still in the very early stages.  As has been shown, a variety of effective drugs have been established to relieve PD symptoms but they do not offer a cure.  The development of an orally active prodrug that can compete with L-DOPA without longterm complications is clearly significant, however it seems very clear that more emphasis on determining the root cause of PD is still the best hope of a real breakthrough.
        FEEDBACK: This option refers back to the body of the essay and then draws a conclusion.  This is a very good model, reminding the reader of the essay content, and bringing the whole thing to a satisfying and informative end.  This is the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Parkinson's comes second to Altzheimer's Disease as the UK's most common neurdegenerative condition. More needs to be known about the root cause.  This is where research should be concentrated.
        FEEDBACK: This option is a little abrupt and the information about where Parkinson's comes on the UK's neurdegenerative tables would be better placed in the introduction.  A good conclusion should refer back to the themes of the essay, which this does not do.  This is not the best option on offer. 
        ANSWER: The reason I chose Parkinson's Disease as my essay topic is that my grandfather suffers from it.  I have therefore seen at first hand its symptoms: speech problems; cognitive/mood disturbances; and autonomic disorders.  As this essay has shown, the need for more research into the root cause is more likely to lead to a cure than any drug.  It is root cause research that money should be invested.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is too personal.  As an academic, you must remain objective, so this is not the right forum to speak about a relation.  Save personal stuff for a fund-raising appeal or a piece of personal journalism.  This is not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Research into nacre recently has been extensive.  Scientists are even exploring the possibility of using nacre as armour because it is so resistant and light.  These simple sea shells contain interesting properties upon inspection!
        FEEDBACK: Never finish an academic essay with an exclamation mark. Indeed, never use an exclamation mark in an academic essay.  Though exclamation marks now litter people's writing, they do have a very particular use:  they should follow an exclamation like Stop! or Danger!  The exclamation mark alone means that this is not the best option on offer.
        ANSWER: As has been demonstrated, molluscs are able to biomineralize a tough exterior as a protection mechanism.  The shell consists of an outer prismatic calcite layer and an inner aragonitic nacreous layer.  Both layers are composed of CaCO3 but exist as polymorphs of each other.  The nacreous layer, being one of the hardest substances known, is associated with osteogenic studies and thus has major implications for medicine and even for the arms industry.  The sea shell may be a familiar sight but all its hidden complexities have not yet been fully explored.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion refers back to the essay title, and neatly summarises what we should remember.  The ending is satisfactory and clear.  I think this is the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, as Lowenstam and Weiner remind us, 'biomineralisation refers to the process by which organisms form minerals ... when organisms evolved the ability to form mineralised hard parts, they provided themselves with a major adaptional advantage.' 10
        FEEDBACK: Ending your essay with a quote is not wrong, but be careful.  This quotation would fit much better at the start of the essay.  A quote at the end of your essay needs to wrap up your conclusions, not give a definition of the title.  This is not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Wikipedia might be right, it might be wrong.  Nobody checks.   Don't use it.
        ANSWER: A. D. Mount, PhD Thesis, Imperial College London (UCL), 1977
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A PhD thesis passed by UCL will have certainly been reviewed by experts.  
        ANSWER: A. R. Jones, Angew. Chem., submitted
        FEEDBACK: This source has obviously not yet been passed by reviewers.  You may be able to use it if you acknowledge the fact that it has not yet passed the reviewers.  This could happen if it is reporting on pioneering research, not yet in the public domain.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: http://alzheimers.org.uk
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It may seem strange, but in most respects, this source would not be reliable enough for an academic essay.  Some information may be usable, for example the number of people affected by the disease in the UK.  However, organisations are often lobbying for something, so their information is written to solicit a specific reaction - perhaps money.  Academics need objective sources.
        ANSWER: A. S. Reber, Dictionary of Psychology, second edition, 1995
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A published dictionary will be reliable.  However, some of the information may be out of date.  
        ANSWER: E. Tobinick, TNF-alpha Modulation for Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: a 6-month pilot study, MedGenMed
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is a reliable source.  Just because a study is a pilot, it doesn't make the information unreliable.  If you look up MedGenMed, you'll see it's a peer reviewed journal.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Semi-colons link two complete sentences.  In neither sentence 1 nor sentence 2 is this the case.  You cannot make two complete sentences out of this text. This should tell you that a semi-colon has no place in this sentence.

        FEEDBACK: I agree. These types of words (adverbs) - equally, however, moreover, nonetheless, etc. - do not need colons.  Colons make the pause much too pronounced.  A comma is correct.  'Equally, Juno ...'  The second colon is fine, since the information that follows it expands on what comes before,

    QUESTION 0 What could we put in place of the dash?
        ANSWER: A comma.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A comma allows the sentence to run on even though there are two distinct thoughts.  
        ANSWER: A semi-colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A semi-colon would separate these two closely connected sentences very nicely.
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Sometimes semi-colons and colons are just a matter of taste.  You could certainly argue that the second part of the sentence expands on the first, and therefore that a colon was best.
    QUESTION 1 Are dashes ever appropriate?
        ANSWER: Sometimes.
        FEEDBACK: Sometimes dashes are appropriate.  They indicate an aside, i.e. something important - perhaps a reminder - inserted into the text, just as you might insert something into the conversation.
        ANSWER: Never.

    QUESTION 0 How many commas would you put in this sentence?
        ANSWER: One.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think there are too many sub-clauses in this sentence for only one comma.
        ANSWER: Two.
        FEEDBACK: I think two would be fine.  I'd put one after 'Athens' and the next after 'Parthenon', to enclose the sub-clause 'whose residents built the Parthenon'.
        ANSWER: Three.
        FEEDBACK: You could put three in: one after 'Athens'; one after 'Parthenon'; and one after 'her'.  This would give the sentence two sub-clauses:  'whose residents built the Parthenon' and 'a temple to worship her'.  I think this makes the sentence too disjointed, so I'd opt for two commas.
        ANSWER: None: it's fine as it is.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  When you have a sentence that is not just one thought, you need commas to make the thoughts clear.  Think of the reader.

        FEEDBACK: That's partially right.  Try again!
        ANSWER: Before and after each 'however'.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'However' in this context is a small sub-clause, i.e. it qualifies the sentence.  If you enclose each 'however' between commas, the sentences flow better.

INTRO <font size="4">Cicero issued a senatus consultum ultimum, (<span style="font-style: italic;">final decree of the senate</span>), a decree passed in times of emergency. Some argued that the consultum could not override the basic laws of the Roman state, but that it gave consuls power to do their utmost <span style="font-style: italic;">within the framework of the Roman constitution</span> to resolve the situation. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should (final decree of the senate) be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes.  A translation needs to be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Translations don't need to be italicised.  
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Translations shouldn't be italicised.
    QUESTION 1 Should senatus consultum ultimum be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  All words in languages other than English or Greek should be italicised unless they have passed into our language and are used familiarly, e.g. senate, senator, forum etc. (Senatus, in this example, is in Latin not English form).
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  All words in languages other than English or Greek should be italicised unless they have passed into our language and are used familiarly, e.g. senate, senator, forum etc.  (Senatus, in this example, is in Latin not English form).
    QUESTION 2 There's another word that should be italicised.  What is it?
        ANSWER: emergency.
        FEEDBACK: No - that's a perfectly ordinary English word.
        ANSWER: consuls
        FEEDBACK: No.  This word has passed into common usage, so, like senator, should not be italicised.
        ANSWER: consultum
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This word is Latin, so should be italicised.
    QUESTION 3 Should 'within the framework' etc. be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  In some circumstances, for example if you had been writing of a constitutional debate, you might italicise 'within the framework' etc. for emphasis.  In this context, however, it should not be italicised.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: In some circumstances, for example if you had been writing of a constitutional debate, you might italicise 'within the framework' etc. for emphasis.  In this context, however, it should not be italicised.

        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  This 'Antigone' refers to the title of the play, so should be italicised. 
        ANSWER: The second.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  This 'Antigone' refers to the heroine's name.  Take care when the name of the play and the name of the hero or heroine are the same.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />How does either Ovid in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Fasti</span> or Petronius in 'Dinner at Tremalchio's' use different literary traditions to create a new kind of work relevant to contemporary Rome?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Which are the best opening lines?
        ANSWER: Ovid's Fasti is a truly unique work of its time.  He uses different literary traditions to make the work relevant to the world in which it was written. 
        FEEDBACK: These lines tell us virtually nothing.  Best to start your essay with a bang rather than a whimper.
        ANSWER: Ovid was a Roman poet who wrote a number of works, the best known of which is his Metamorphoses.  Petronius was a Roman courtier, living at the time of the Emperor Nero.  
        FEEDBACK: These lines are informative, but rather simplistic.  An academic essay should not just list information, but should try and seize the question right from the first line.  The essay question should always be the direct focus of the text.
        ANSWER: Ovid's Fasti and Petronius's 'Dinner at Tremalchio's' were written for different reasons:  the Fasti to complain, and 'Dinner at Tremalchio's' to entertain.  Neither complaints nor entertainment were novel in themselves, but unexpected content and use of metre offered something new to contemporary Rome, and both writers will have been aware of the novelty.
        FEEDBACK: This is an interesting start, which shows that the writer is actively engaging with the question.  We learn facts, but the facts are embedded into the question, adding weight, not just words, to the essay.  This is the best option.

    QUESTION 0 Choose the best opening line(s) for this essay title.
        ANSWER: Publius Virgilius Maro was the son of a farmer and believed to have been educated at home, then in Cremona, Milan and Rome, where he studied rhetoric, medicine and astronomy.
        FEEDBACK: Biographical details might be included to underpin an argument, but to list them like this has no value in an essay.   Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: 'Divine Aeneas' (Aeneid, p.640) , the hero of the Aeneid legend, possessed all the qualities deemed heroic in a Roman citizen when Virgil, perhaps Rome's greatest poet, was writing.
        FEEDBACK: This is a very good start.  It gets to grip with the essay question at once, and in a sophisticated way.  Beginning with a short quotation (properly attributed) adds weight to an opening line.
        ANSWER: Virgil chose the Aeneid legend as the principle subject of his epic because the Aeneid legend incorporated many ideas and stories that would be very useful to make the points Virgil wanted to make.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is very uninspiring.  Instead of telling the reader that there are ideas and stories, why not cut straight to the chase and open with one of these stories or ideas, then showing why this story or idea was important to Virgil?  Too many essays don't really get going until page 2.  An essay with this opening line might well turn into one of those.  Not the best option.

        ANSWER: When talking about the time of the Catilinarian conspiracy, we are looking at an important part of the decline and fall of the Roman Republic.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line makes far too general a point, in far too wordy a manner.  Your opening line must grasp the essay topic, not tiptoe around it.  A strong opening line gives the reader confidence.  Take some trouble over it. 
        ANSWER: Though Cicero's speeches against Catiline contain some of his most famous utterances - O tempora!  O mores - and Sallust's account of what is known as the Catiline conspiracy is gripping and colourful, as hard evidence for the causes of the conspiracy both are highly questionable. 
        FEEDBACK: I like this option.  We get straight into the texts with a neat use of quotation and description, and the question is directly addressed.  I think this is the best option.
        ANSWER: The invasion of Italy had resulted in civil war and after Caesar defeated Pompey, he made himself dictator for life.  Cicero re-established the senate and Octavian (later Augustus) took control of the armies.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line falls into the 'I'm going to tell you all I know about ancient Rome' category.  You must grasp the essay question from the first line to the last.  This is a very poor option.

        ANSWER: Tragedy is a 'form of art based on human suffering' (Wikipedia, 2010).
        FEEDBACK: A quotation often adds weight and punch to an opening line, but a quotation from Wikipedia is too unreliable and idle to achieve either of these benefits.  Don't use Wikipedia in academic essays.  There are plenty of reliable books in the library.  Not a good option.
        ANSWER: In form, Greek tragedy arose from 'a choral song in honour of Dionysus'.  The content, however, was less concerned with honour than with recounting 'terrible things about great people' (Leech 1969: 13-14).  It is in judging how far these 'terrible things' had wider significance than the immediate story that the answer to the essay question can be found.
        FEEDBACK: This is a thoughtful and interesting with a good use of quotation.  The reader would have confidence in an opening like this because the writer seems to know where he/she is going.  I'd say this was the best option.
        ANSWER: In Book V of the Poetics, Aristotle tells us that 'tragedy endeavours to keep as far as possible within a single circuit of the sun, or something near that'.  When trying to discover whether Greek tragedy led or followed political debate in Athens, Aristotle cannot be ignored.
        FEEDBACK: This is an odd option, since the quotation appears to have nothing to do with the question.  If you use a quotation that doesn't immediately appear relevant, you must link it up with the essay question.  If you cannot, then you need to find a different quotation.  This is not a good option.

        ANSWER: The Athenian empire was very effective in using public space in Athens to create and promote political identity.
        FEEDBACK: Just repeating the terms of the question without adding anything is a very dull and uninspiring start to an essay.  If you find yourself doing this, go back to the opening line when you've finished your essay and see if you can improve it.  This is not a good option.
        ANSWER: All the evidence from existing records, both written and built, shows that public space in Athens was considered an important tool in the political armoury.
        FEEDBACK: This is a strong opening statement, which bodes well for the rest of the essay.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: The Athenian Agora was an important space in which people could openly converse and debate.
        FEEDBACK: Presented with this, a reader might turn the page back to see if he or she had missed something.  This line has a place in the essay, but not right at the start.  You need to set the scene, even if in one brief sentence.

        ANSWER: To be a poet in the age of Augustus was to be a public figure, and in imperial Rome, public figures walked a political tightrope that could, according to the whim of the emperor, end in glory or ignominy.
        FEEDBACK: This first line provides an excellent opening: it sets the scene without wasting any words.  I think this is the best choice.
        ANSWER: Augustus gained supreme authority in Rome and control of what was to become the Roman Empire after defeating Marc Antony at Actium in 31BC.
        FEEDBACK: This is true, but you should use your first line to grasp the essay question, not just to recite a list of facts.  This is a dull option.
        ANSWER: Horace, Ovid and Virgil were all poets in the age of Augustus and this essay will use their lives and works to assess whether Augustan poets were politically motivated to support Augustus's leadership and whether their work reflects their views of Augustus.
        FEEDBACK: It's good to refer to the terms of the essay question, but it's much less good simply to repeat them.  This opening line gives an impression of slightly desperate padding out before we've even got going.

        ANSWER: The portrayal of masculinity and femininity in Virgil's Aeneid is a portrayal not of stereotypes but of power.   
        FEEDBACK: This opening line makes a bold statement.  The final part of the sentence opens up a discussion.  An excellent start to an essay. 
        ANSWER: In Virgil's Aeneid, masculinity and femininity are portrayed in different ways.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is a statement of the obvious.  If you took it out of the essay, nothing would be lost.  It is not a good option.
        ANSWER: The Aeneid was written at a time when the roles of men and women are seen differently from the roles of men and women today.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line threatens to send the essay down the wrong path.  The essay question asks about the portrayal of masculinity and femininity, not the roles of men and women.  Be careful to stick to the question asked.  The rephrasing means that this option is not a good one.

        ANSWER: Revenge is a dish best served cold, so we are told, but the ancient Greeks served it hot, cold and every temperature in between.
        FEEDBACK: I can see what the writer is trying to do here: inject life into the essay.  But I'm not sure it quite works.  You can only really use this type of opening when you're established as an expert.  This opening is not wrong, but I'd say it sets a lighter tone than might be advisable.
        ANSWER: Homer probably lived in the eighth century BC.  He wrote both the Illiad and the Odyssey, which are thought to be the first epic poems.
        FEEDBACK: You need to grasp the question, rather than just present historical facts.  This is not a particularly good option.
        ANSWER: Beginning with Homer, revenge is a popular theme in much ancient Greek literature and in his Oresteia, Aeschylus, like many others, mines this rich seam.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line sets the scene succinctly.  I think this is the best option.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />What were the Spartan war aims in Asia Minor from 399 to 394 B.C. and how effectively were they achieved?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Which is the best concluding line for this essay?
        ANSWER: How effective were the Spartans in achieving their war aims between 399 and 394 B.C.?  Not very because their efforts were doomed before they began, so in the end, Sparta did not effectively achieve her objectives.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It is not good practice simply to repeat the essay question as a question.  You certainly need to refer to the terms of the question, but putting them into context, using themes from your essay.  Your reader needs to feel a sense of a question properly worked through and answered.  This example leaves the reader feeling flat. 
        ANSWER: In their aim to unit Greece under Spartan leadership, the Spartans were unsuccessful, and even the taking of the Asia Minor Greeks' cities from Persia was undermined by an inability to defeat the Persians in open battle.  Yet the Spartans were never defeated themselves, and at Sardis, though indirectly, they removed Tissaphernes,  On balance, however, the results are too far removed from the objectives to say that the Spartans were successful, and certainly this has been the judgment of history. 
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines successfully refer to themes that will have been included in the essay, and leave the reader satisfied that the question has been examined and answered.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: Though the Spartans had some successes, for example they removed Tissphernes and successfully garrisoned towns they took from the Persians, they also failed to deliver a knock-out blow to their enemies.  Yet since they did not wholly fail in their objectives, we cannot say they were not effective at all.
        FEEDBACK: These lines refer back to the essay title, and to some of the essay's themes.  However, they are too colloquial:  the term 'knock out blow' is too informal for an academic essay, and the subjective 'we' adds to the informal tone.  In addition, the writer gives a weak final answer to the question.  Be brave!

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />What were the causes of the Catilinarian conspiracy? How good are Cicero's Catalinarian speeches and Sallust's <span style="font-style: italic;">Catiline</span> as evidence for it?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Knowing this, it is still hard to know how good these two sources are for evidence of a conspiracy.  With the help of a third party source we could possibly see if the speculation was enough to go on with some real fact and actions or whether it was just suspicion at a time of distress in Rome.
        FEEDBACK: This is a poor option, not because the conclusion drawn is a bad one - it's not - but the phrasing is clumsy and trips the reader up.  Remember that how you write is as important as what you write.
        ANSWER: These sources certainly provide some evidence.  However, as this essay has shown, Cicero's speeches tell us more about Cicero than the conspiracy, and Sallust is constrained both by the shadow of his patron and his own moral outrage.  Yet neither work should be discounted in the search for evidence of the Catiline conspiracy; both works contain a great deal of information.  That information must simply be processed not as evidence, but as a partial part of the picture.
        FEEDBACK: I like this option.  It refers directly to the essay question and the texts under discussion, and finally draws a logical conclusion.  The best option of these three.
        ANSWER: The causes of the Catilinarian conspiracy are so bound up with personal grudge and egos that they are impossible to discern, so we have as little evidence for it now as they did at the time.
        FEEDBACK: This is a little abrupt and, though what the writer writes is true, the tone of these lines leave the reader feeling flat.  Try and finish your essay with a flourish.  Even a poor essay can often be redeemed, at least slightly, by a good last line.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, the essence of Greek tragedy is the conflict between political (and paternal) authority on the one hand, and personal obligation on the other.  In the plays cited here, these are too deeply intertwined to provide evidence as to whether Greek tragedy led or followed political debate in Athens.  That they both reflected and informed debate, however, is indisputable and, for modern readers, is part of their drama. 
        FEEDBACK: This option uses the terms of the question to draw the essay to an excellent close.  Of the options available, I think this is the best.
        ANSWER: Was Greek tragedy leading or following political debate in Athens?  The evidence seems to show that it neither led nor followed, but was just part of the debate. 
        FEEDBACK: Simply repeating the terms of the question can sometimes work, but often makes the end of an essay very flat.  You want to keep your reader's interest right to the end.  This ending is a bit of a damp squib.  Not the best option.
        ANSWER: Antigone's personal fate is a real expression of Creon's political theory and the play may well have provoked the Athenian citizenry to question what happens when the state meets the personal and neither will give way.
        FEEDBACK: There is nothing wrong with this sentence, except it doesn't feel like a concluding line. Concluding lines must draw together all the strands of your essay and not simply come to a halt.  This line feels very abrupt.  I don't think this is the best option.

        ANSWER: Thus it can be argued that If 'what is new and innovative must be built on the foundations of inherited tradition' (Euben, 1982: 27), then Aeschylus's Oresteia is not a depiction of the Homeric image of revenge, but a development from it.
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear answer to the question, with a very well chosen quote to give that final punch.  I think this is the best option.
        ANSWER: I have shown that Aeschylus's Oresteia depicts the Homeric image of revenge to a very great extent and even develops it.
        FEEDBACK: The sentiments expressed in this concluding line are the same as in the first option, but not nearly so well expressed.  You need to craft your concluding lines so that your reader feels a sense of closure and satisfaction.  This concluding line is very flat, so it's not the best option here.
        ANSWER: What is revenge, except, as they say, 'a dish best served cold'?  We all, not just Aeschylus, owe a huge debt to Homer, because without Homer we would never have had Shakespeare!
        FEEDBACK: This may be true, and it is always tempting to end an essay with a broad, rhetorical flourish.  But few of us are Homer, and broad, rhetorical flourishes, particularly those ending in an exclamation mark, often make the reader wince.  For this reason, I don't like this option.

        ANSWER: The statues of Athena spread across the Acropolis only enhanced its political identity as well as paying tribute to the gods.  Furthermore, the Athenians used the Pynx Hill to promote their political ideology to the Athenian people.
        FEEDBACK: The ideas behind these concluding lines may be sound, but they fit into the argument of an essay, not the conclusion.  Be careful that a reader doesn't end up feeling that a page has been missed out at the end.  This is not a good option.
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, in the ancient world, the public spaces in cities often played key roles in the promotion of political identity.  In this, Athens was no exception.  However, the real success of the Athenian empire's use of Athens' public spaces was in fostering loyalty to the city and the empire in the common man for it was on the attitude of common man that the fate of the empire ultimately depended. 
        FEEDBACK: These lines refer back to the essay question but add something more, bringing this essay to a definite and pleasing halt.  The best option, I think.
        ANSWER: Athens' political identity was effectively increased through its monumentality, as all the new buildings gave a wealthy and powerful perception.

        ANSWER: Any discussion about the primacy of speech over action in Greek tragedy hinges on a definition of action.  In many cases - Oedipus and Ajax, for example - this essay has shown that speech and action are different articulations of the same emotion, and that one loses power without the other.  Nevertheless, it is the words that remain with us, and their power, without actor or stage, proves that though Greek tragedy is, at base, a drama of speech.   
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines have a good ring to them and don't beat about the bush.  Topics from the essay are drawn in and we finish with a proper answer to the essay question.  The best option here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, the fact that speech seems to vitally important in the decision-making of characters, and in the act of providing the tragic elements of the tragedies, it can be said that tragedy is the drama of speech not of action.  Action seems to be used as a final shock, as in the case of Oedipus or Agamemnon where Clytemnestra proudly displays the bodies of her husband and Cassandra, whilst it is words and speech that provide the real, thought-provoking drama.
        FEEDBACK: The thoughts in these concluding lines are fine, but the first sentence is hard to follow.  Clarity is vital all the way through an essay, but to leave a good impression, it's very important not to slip up at the last moment.  The way these concluding lines are written means they are not a good choice.
        ANSWER: Staging events in plays, for example the earthquake in The Bacchae, was difficult, so it is unsurprising that Greek tragedy was the drama of speech rather than action.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line seems very trite: the essay question was clearly about more than staging events.  Not a good option.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Were the Augustan poets politically motivated to support Augustus's leadership? In what way does their work reflect their views of Augustus?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Augustus died in on 19th August AD14 and was succeeded by his stepson, Tiberius, who had also been his son-in-law and his adopted son.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line bears no relation to the essay question.  Not a good option.
        ANSWER: Whatever the motives of the poets who wrote for him and about him, Augustus seems to have appreciated much of the poetry for its own sake, and though some of the poets' views of their emperor were not always completely adulatory, the emperor seems usually to have appreciated their efforts.
        FEEDBACK: This option focuses on Augustus rather than the poets, and it's the poets who should be centre stage.  Not a bad option, but not the best of the choices on offer.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, whether Augustus was Tacitus's bully or Suetonius's kindlier figure, the Augustan poets, Ovid in particular, seemed to be driven more by the demands of their poetry than of their emperor.   None of the poets discussed in this essay are cyphers, yet all seem to have been aware, as Horace so memorably said, that 'he gains everyone's approval who mixes the pleasant with the useful' (QuotationsBook, website 1).
        FEEDBACK: This is light and breezy, but still draws the essay to a neat close.  Of the options here, I think this is the best.

    QUESTION 1 Should I mention every text or person discussed in the essay in the concluding lines?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  You need to draw the strands of your essay together, but that doesn't mean repeating yourself, or mentioning everybody or everything again.   Concluding lines are for wrapping up the themes, not for lists.

    QUESTION 2 Should I repeat the essay title in my concluding lines?
        ANSWER: No.

    QUESTION 0 In this context, the phrase 'of accepting' is poor use of English.  What should the phrase be?
        ANSWER: about accepting
        FEEDBACK: 'About accepting' would certainly be better, though it reinforces the notion that no decision has yet been made.  When you write, think about what inferences the reader might draw from the words you choose. Try the other choices.

        FEEDBACK: 'In accepting' won't work.  It makes no sense.
        ANSWER: to accept
        FEEDBACK: 'To accept' would work.  To me, it implies that Agesilaus doesn't want to take responsibility for the decision.  Is this what the writer meant, do you think?   When you write, think about what inferences the reader might draw from the words you choose.

    QUESTION 0 Should this quotation be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Quotations should never be italicised unless they are in italics in the original text, in which case you should indicate this by writing [sic] (Latin for 'thus').  This shows that you have presented the quote as written in the original.

    QUESTION 1 Is this quotation suitable for a Classics essay?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Quotations from secondary sources are supposed to reinforce your argument, not make your argument for you.  They should be limited to a word or a phrase.  Quotations from primary sources, e.g. from Virgil, Homer or other classical authors, can be longer.
        ANSWER: No.

        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This system is the easiest to use.

    QUESTION 0 Is this a good use of quotation?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The quotation itself is fine but it's not smoothly incorporated into the sentence.  The writer flags it up unnecessarily.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Though the quotation itself is fine, it's not smoothly incorporated into the sentence.  The writer flags it up unnecessarily.

        ANSWER: The ellipses (...) irritate. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Ellipses are the proper way to show that part of a quotation has been left out.
        ANSWER: The quote is too long.
        FEEDBACK: It is long, but that's not the real problem.
        ANSWER: There is a mismatch between the emperor and the quotation.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It jars to mention the commissioner of the epic, Augustus, who died AD 14, and then, in the same breath and with no further comment, quote praise from 1972.
    QUESTION 2 There is a major error in the reference.  What is it?
        ANSWER: The date should come last.
        FEEDBACK: No, the date is fine where it is.
        ANSWER: Haskell House is the name of the publishers, and we need the name of the author.

        ANSWER: A government makes decisions that backfire.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. The writer seems to be saying that the government makes decisions that may become controversial if they backfire (i.e. if those decisions affect members of the parliament).
        ANSWER: Governments controversially think like common people.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. The policies, not governments, are controversial, although members of parliament may well think like 'common people'. 
        ANSWER: A government has to make decisions on security issues and threats, and its members will be affected by the decisions made, such as telephone conversations being recorded.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. 
        ANSWER: Common people make decisions about telephone conversations.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. Although this is indirectly what the writer is saying, it's not the key meaning of the sentence.

INTRO <font size="4">The purpose of implanting microchips into children's bodies is to make them easier to identify.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 This sentence is ambiguous.  How?
        ANSWER: It's not clear what the purpose of microchipping is.
        FEEDBACK: No - that's not where the ambiguity arises.
        ANSWER: It's not clear who is needing to be identified:  the microchips or the children.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  Microchips are the subject of the sentence, so when we meet the word 'them', we automatically feel it refers to microchips, although the writer means 'them' to refer to children.
    QUESTION 1 How can this problem be rectified?
        ANSWER: It can't be rectified:  we just have to assume readers are intelligent enough to make proper sense of the sentence.
        FEEDBACK: No, we can rectify the problem - and no matter how intelligent the reader is, he or she should not be required to make proper sense of the sentence.  Making proper sense of the sentence is the writer's responsibility.
        ANSWER: It can be rectified by inserting the correct subject (children) near the verb (to identify).
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The sentence would then read:  The purpose of implanting microchips into children's bodies is to make children easier to identify.

    QUESTION 0 There is an apostrophe missing from this sentence - which of the following words is the correct one?
        ANSWER: friend's
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The apostrophe is used here to indicate that the DVD belongs to a friend.
        ANSWER: friends'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The apostrophe here indicates that the DVD belongs to several friends, but we know it only belongs to one: 'a friend'.
        ANSWER: CD's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Apostrophes are never used to form plurals. Making an acronym or abbreviation plural can be hard because not using an apostrophe may look weird.  However, weird or not, no apostrophe is needed!
        ANSWER: DVD's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  An apostrophe is never used to make a plural. Click on the blue question mark above the exercises for more information.

    QUESTION 0 An apostrophe is needed in the phrase 'users inboxes' to demonstrate that the inboxes belong to more than one user. Which of the following options is correct?
        ANSWER: user's inboxes
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This means that the inboxes belong to only one user.
        ANSWER: users inboxe's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  We're looking for an apostrophe to indicate to whom the inboxes belong.  In addition, 'inboxes' is a plain plural and plain plurals never need apostrophes.
        ANSWER: users' inboxes
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Here, the apostrophe signals that the inboxes belong to all the users.

    QUESTION 0 There are two apostrophe errors in this sentence. Choose the corrected words from the options provided below.
        ANSWER: person's (first instance), other's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - 'others' is a plural here so does not need an apostrophe.
        ANSWER: person's (second instance), others'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - others is a plural here, but not possessive, so does not need an apostrophe.
        ANSWER: person's (first instance), person's (second instance)
        FEEDBACK: Correct - 'person' is singular, so the apostrophe must come before the 's' that makes it a possessive (the privacy of the person; the telephone call of another person).
        ANSWER: persons's (first instance), persons's (second instance)
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - 'person' is singular here so doesn't need an 's' before the apostrophe.

    QUESTION 0 There is an apostrophe error in the sentence. Which word is affected?
        ANSWER: views
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  'Views' is a plain plural and does not need an apostrophe.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises to remind yourself of the rules.
        ANSWER: societies
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Now answer the next question below.
        ANSWER: exists
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  'Exists' is a verb and so does not need an apostrophe.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises to remind yourself of the rules.
    QUESTION 1 What should the affected word be changed to?
        ANSWER: societies'
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This is a possessive plural, so needs an apostrophe after the final 's'
        ANSWER: societie's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Even if we were talking about a single society instead of many societies, the singular of society is 'society', not 'societie'
        ANSWER: society's
        FEEDBACK: This could be correct if the writer was talking about one society.  Actually, in the context of the essay, the writer was talking of many societies, so the apostrophe should, in this case, come after the final 's':  societies' 
        ANSWER: societys'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.   We need the proper plural spelling, then a possessive apostrophe.  Press the blue question mark for further explanation and examples.

    QUESTION 0 There is an apostrophe error in the sentence. Which word is affected?
        ANSWER: liberties
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. This word is a plain plural and so should not have an apostrophe.
        ANSWER: everyone
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  'Everyone' is fine as it is.
        ANSWER: elses
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Elses' needs an apostrophe after the final 's' because it is a plural possessive (the liberties of everyone else).
    QUESTION 1 What should the affected word be changed to?
        ANSWER: else
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This makes the word singular and the writer wants it to be plural.
        ANSWER: elses'
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This is a plural, so needs a possessive plural apostrophe after the final 's'
        ANSWER: else's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This would mean just one person's liberties and the writer means many peoples' liberties.

    QUESTION 0 'Persons' isn't quite the right word in this sentence. Which of the alternatives is correct?
        ANSWER: persons'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If we wanted to say that it was an infringement of the privacy of several people, we would use the possessive (and plural) people's, not persons'
        ANSWER: person's
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  As we're only talking about one person, we only need to talk about the privacy of that one person. Therefore, the apostrophe is inserted before the possessive 's'.
        ANSWER: people's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  We're only talking about the privacy of a person here (only one person).
        ANSWER: peoples
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  We're only talking about the privacy of one person here, certainly not that of several 'peoples'. People is only made plural if several races or tribes are being discussed.

INTRO Given that the popularity of email in 2002 was great that that of traditional mail, which incurs a charge: I intend to argue that if a fee were charged to send an email, fewer would be sent that when the service was free. 
    QUESTION 0 The writer has used a colon to break up this sentence. Which punctuation mark do you think would be better suited here?
        ANSWER: full stop
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - a full stop would create two sentences, the first of which would be an incomplete sentence. 
        ANSWER: semi-colon
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - a semi-colon is used to link two closely related sentences. Here, the first clause is not a sentence in its own right - it needs the text after the colon to make sense.
        ANSWER: comma
        FEEDBACK: Correct - the first clause provides the conditions for the second: it is a 'If X, then Y' type of construct, whereby the comma provides a flowing link between the two.
        ANSWER: no punctuation mark at all
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - removing the colon and not replacing it with anything would make the sentence harder to read, and may distract the reader from the meaning.

    QUESTION 0 A colon is required in this sentence: where would you put it?
        ANSWER: after 'in three ways', replacing the semi-colon
        FEEDBACK: Correct. Colons can be used to introduce a list, which is exactly how one should be used here.
        ANSWER: after 'collective security', replacing the semi-colon
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. This item is part of the list, so the semi-colon here is correct.
        ANSWER: at the end of the sentence
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. Colons always introduce more information. Full stops are the only punctuation mark that can be used at the end of a sentence.
        ANSWER: after 'approached'

    QUESTION 0 Should the comma in this sentence be...?
        ANSWER: left where it is
        FEEDBACK: The sentence cannot be left as it is - a comma should never be used to link two whole sentences together.
        ANSWER: replaced with a full stop
        FEEDBACK: The sentence could be broken into two sentences at the point of the comma. Both sentences would then be correctly punctuated, but both would then be rather abrupt and the link between them would not flow naturally.
        ANSWER: replaced with a semi-colon
        FEEDBACK: The ideal solution here is to replace the comma with a semi-colon. This would make the sentence grammatically correct and maintain a clear close link between the two sentences.

<p> My opinion is that those who are now addicted to the virtual world, would have been addicted to something else in the absence of the Internet. </p> 
    QUESTION 0 The sentence below has one comma. What would you do with it?
        ANSWER: keep it, and add another comma after 'those'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - in some situations, you might want to turn 'who are now addicted to the virtual world' into a sub-clause, but here the phrase plays a critical part in defining who 'those' are, so it shouldn't be enclosed within commas.
        ANSWER: keep it
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this comma separates the subject ('those...addicted to the virtual world') and the verb ('would have been...'), which commas should never do.
        ANSWER: remove it
        FEEDBACK: Correct - no comma is needed in this sentence. For more info about how commas are used, click on the blue question mark near the top of the page.

        FEEDBACK: Correct - it's inserting an unnecessary break in the sentence.
        ANSWER: leave it where it is
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this comma serves no purpose here. It's put an unnecessary break between the subject ('the consequences of which') and the verb ('were').
        ANSWER: move it to after 'of'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - a comma after 'of' would insert the break in a different wrong place!
        ANSWER: move it to after 'job'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - a comma after 'job' isn't needed here as the list of thing that Mr XX did (losing his job and selling his home) is short, and does not need breaking up in any way.

<p><font size="4"> It is possible to assume that at some stage e-societies may even become equally important, as the societies, in which we live today. </font></p> 
    QUESTION 0 What would you do with the commas in this sentence?
        ANSWER: leave them where they are
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - these commas break up the sentence, making it hard to read and understand.
        ANSWER: keep the first one, delete the second one
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the first comma inserts a break between 'important' and 'as', which need to be together in order for the phrase to make sense - what is 'equally important' as e-societies?
        ANSWER: remove both
        FEEDBACK: Correct - this sentence doesn't need any commas; it's easiest to understand without them.
        ANSWER: delete the first one, keep the second one
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the first second inserts a break between 'societies' and 'in which we live today', which need to be together in order for the phrase to make sense - it must be clear which societies are being talked about.

    QUESTION 0 Which of the following alternatives do you think works best?
        ANSWER: I think that, because the amount charged to users would be less than say ten pence, it is not enough to punish the people who spam and abuse the system.
        FEEDBACK: Possible. This option is feasible - if you take out the words between the two commas, the sentence does make sense, but it feels as if information is missing. 'I think that it is not enough to punish the people who spam and abuse the system.' Therefore, the words between the commas are crucial to the reader's understanding of the sentence (and thus the argument).
        ANSWER: I think that because the amount charged to users would be less than, say, ten pence it is not enough to punish the people who spam and abuse the system. 
        FEEDBACK: Correct. This option works well - taking out the word encased by commas doesn't affect the meaning at all. That word only shows that the ten pence is a suggestion, which is not absolutely crucial to the reader's understanding of the sentence.
        ANSWER: I think that because the amount charged to users, would be less than say ten pence, it is not enough to punish the people who spam and abuse the system.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. If you remove the words between the commas, the sentence does not make sense: 'I think that because the amount charged to users it is not enough to punish the people who spam and abuse the system.'
        ANSWER: I think that because the amount charged to users would be less than, say ten pence it is not enough to punish, the people who spam and abuse the system.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. If you remove the words between the commas, the sentence does not make sense: 'I think that because the amount charged to users would be less than the people who spam and abuse the system.'

    QUESTION 0 Should the comma in this sentence be...?
        ANSWER: left where it is
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. The comma should not be left where it is - it interrupts the sentence unnecessarily here. 
        ANSWER: moved to after 'move'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. It is important to keep 'move from traditional social methods' together so that no meaning is lost.
        ANSWER: removed
        FEEDBACK: Correct. There is no need for a comma in this sentence at all - it is grammatically correct, and it makes sense, without a comma.
        ANSWER: replaced with a colon
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. A colon is used to indicate that more information about what precedes it will follow after it - this certainly wouldn't be the case here.

INTRO For instance, as reported in <span style="font-style: italic;">Metro </span>on 18 November 2008; a list of 10,000 members of the British National Party was published on the internet and members' privacy was compromised. 
    QUESTION 0 In this sentence, a semi-colon has been used. Would you change it to something else?
        ANSWER: No - it's fine as it is 
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - semi-colons are used to break up two related sentences, but here it's just interrupting one sentence.
        ANSWER: Yes - a full stop
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. If you did that, you would have two sentences - the first of which wouldn't make any sense.
        ANSWER: Yes - a colon
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. A colon is used to introduce a list or an additional piece of information.
        ANSWER: Yes - a comma
        FEEDBACK: Correct - a comma means that 'as reports in Metro on 18 November 2008' becomes a distinct clause within the sentence. It could be removed and the meaning of the sentence would not be changed.

    QUESTION 0 The semi-colon has been used incorrectly in this sentence. Which do you think is the best alternative?
        ANSWER: The question then arises. Will we become more dependent on the internet?
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - in this context, this new first sentence doesn't really make any sense.
        ANSWER: The question then arises: will we become more dependent on the internet?
        FEEDBACK: Correct - here a colon works really well. It indicates that what comes after the colon will be the question that has arisen.
        ANSWER: The question then arises, will we become more dependent on the internet?
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the comma doesn't lead into the question as neatly as another punctuation mark would.
        ANSWER: The question then arises - will we become more dependent on the internet?
        FEEDBACK: Possible. The dash can be used in this way - to lead to more information. It's maybe not the 'best' punctuation mark to use, but it does work reasonably well here.

    QUESTION 0 This sentence is essentially two whole sentences put together - a semi-colon could be used to break the sentence appropriately. Where would you put the semi-colon?
        ANSWER: after 'clique', replacing the comma
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. Replacing that comma would break the sentence too soon - the first segment needs to remain linked to 'becomes less possible...'
        ANSWER: after 'explodes', replacing the comma
        FEEDBACK: Correct. Replacing that comma with a semi-colon would neatly break the sentences into two parts, with the second sentence leading on naturally from the first.
        ANSWER: after 'nevertheless', replacing the comma
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. Replacing that comma would make it unclear what the 'nevertheless' relates to - it doesn't really fit in with what would become the first part.
        ANSWER: after 'non-face-to-face'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. This would still leave the main two parts of the sentence unbroken, would make it unclear what 'non-face-to-face' refers to, and would leave 'or other indirect means of communication' out on a limb.

    QUESTION 0 What in this sentence needs to be changed?
        ANSWER: Nothing
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the sentence should not stay as it is.
        ANSWER: the semi-colon needs to be changed to a colon
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - that wouldn't rectify the issues with this sentence.
        ANSWER: the 'A' after the semi-colon should be lower case
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - that wouldn't rectify the issues with this sentence
        ANSWER: the semi-colon needs to be change to a colon AND the 'A' after the semi-colon should be lower case.
        FEEDBACK: Correct - both these things need to be changed to make the sentence acceptable. Capital letters never appear after a colon or semi-colon (unless the word is a proper or brand name). Also, as the text that follows the semi-colon doesn't form a complete sentence (it just provides a small piece of extra information), the semi-colon should be changed to a colon.

        ANSWER: The idea of the government should be to create equilibrium through their policies and they should let people know what kind of information they are looking for.  Then, if spying across the telephone network is necessary for the government to ensure safety, they should also ensure confidentiality.
        FEEDBACK: These lines may refer to arguments put forward in the essay but they don't refer directly to the question.   Moreover, the inbuilt contradiction between government spying and individual confidentiality opens up the last sentence for debate, when a last sentence should close the essay down.  
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, eavesdropping by individuals and eavesdropping by governments are not the same thing.  Individuals living in society have given up certain rights, and the right to absolute privacy is one of them.  Any government should be able to listen in on its citizens' telephone conversations.  That eavesdropping by government is often abused is no reason to prohibit it. 
        FEEDBACK: These lines refer directly to the terms of the question and neatly state the essay's main premises.  The last line follows on logically from the arguments.  The reader may disagree with the essay's conclusion, but there is no doubt as to what the conclusion is.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: I think, really, that it's only those who are a threat to society who need monitoring.  All the rest of us should have our right to privacy respected rather than abused.  We should certainly stop our government listening into our conversations.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are clear, but too colloquial.   The phrase 'I think, really' has no place in an academic essay.  Written in slightly more formal style, this ending would be fine.  For example:  Monitoring should be restricted to those who threaten our society.  Other citizens should have their right to privacy respected ... 
        ANSWER: Very little in life is completely right or wrong.  Wiretapping has been used to eavesdrop on citizens' telephone conversations for at least a hundred years.  It would be impossible to stop it.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are true, but much too general.  From them, the reader could neither accurately identify the essay question nor discover the writer's response

        ANSWER: It is everybody's right to go to university.  Universities are the sign of a civilised country.  Sometimes the funding puts people off but it did not put me off.   Ministers should look at that.   
        FEEDBACK: The thoughts in these lines are fine in themselves, but they do not finish the essay off.  Nor would a reader be able to say for certain what the title was.  It could have been:  What puts people off going to university?
        ANSWER: In conclusion, I chose to go to university because I want to increase my stock of knowledge, meet new people and improve my social skills. 
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line is the best because although it may be dull, it appears to draw together the themes of the essay and answers the question directly.  
        ANSWER: The university is a strange place.  It is not at all as I expected.
        FEEDBACK: These lines have wandered off the point.  Could you tell what the essay question was?  No - nor could I.

        ANSWER: Right now, the lines between real and virtual societies are becoming blurred.  Both sides tend to blend into each other.  As people become more comfortable with the internet, a society which is a blend of the current virtual and traditional societies will emerge.
        FEEDBACK: These lines may refer to arguments put forward in the essay but they don't refer directly to the question.   Moreover, the inbuilt contradiction between government spying and individual confidentiality opens up the last sentence for debate, when a last sentence should close the essay down.  
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, eavesdropping by individuals and eavesdropping by governments are not the same thing.  Individuals living in society have given up certain rights, and the right to absolute privacy is one of them.  Any government should be able to listen in on its citizens' telephone conversations.  That eavesdropping by government is often abused is no reason to prohibit it. 
        FEEDBACK: These lines refer directly to the terms of the question and neatly state the essay's main premises.  The last line follows on logically from the arguments.  The reader may disagree with the essay's conclusion, but there is no doubt as to what the conclusion is.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: I think, really, that it's only those who are a threat to society who need monitoring.  All the rest of us should have our right to privacy respected rather than abused.  We should certainly stop our government listening into our conversations.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are clear, but too colloquial.   The phrase 'I think, really' has no place in an academic essay.  Written in slightly more formal style, this ending would be fine.  For example:  Monitoring should be restricted to those who threaten our society.  Other citizens should have their right to privacy respected ... 
        ANSWER: Very little in life is completely right or wrong.  Wiretapping has been used to eavesdrop on citizens' telephone conversations for at least a hundred years.  It would be impossible to stop it.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are true, but much too general.  From them, the reader could neither accurately identify the essay question nor discover the writer's response.   <br />

        ANSWER: The first line here is fine, and the reference adds authority.  But then the text meanders off, wasting words in repetition.   There is no room for meandering in an abstract.  Not the best option.
        FEEDBACK: The feeling behind these lines is quite correct, but the phrasing makes it very clumsy:  repeated words (responsibility) and two rather clichéd generalisations.  If possible, you want to finish with a flourish, or something the marker will remember.<br />
        ANSWER: These lines are crisp and informative.  The past tense - focused - shows the writer has understood the function of his/her abstract, which is to allow a reader to see at once whether this particular Critical Review contains what they are looking for.
        FEEDBACK: 
        ANSWER: The writer of these lines has mistaken their function.  Your abstract should be an overview of your whole Critical Review, conclusions included.  These lines read more like the start of an essay.
        FEEDBACK: All the terms of the question are contained in these concluding sentences, which shows the marker that the writer has not lost his or her way.  It has a nice 'rounding off' feel to it.  This is the best option.<br />

        ANSWER: Now it is up to us to decide whether we are ready to microchip.  Are you?
        FEEDBACK: Concluding with a question is not a good option.  The essay title asks the writer to make an argument for or against microchipping children.  The concluding line needs to reinforce the writer's thesis, not leave the essay open-ended.
        ANSWER: Most importantly, this essay has shown that microchipping has serious privacy implications and for this reason above all others, implanting microchips is an option to be discarded.
        FEEDBACK: This line is clear, wraps up the argument neatly and leaves the reader in no doubt as to the conclusion.  This is the best.
        ANSWER: Really, in the long run, parents are the best people to judge what is best for their children.
        FEEDBACK: 'Really, in the long run' is too colloquial for an academic essay, and the writer shies away from the questions asked in the essay title.  This is not a good option.
        ANSWER: Law and order authorities should remain alert so that kidnappers are caught easily and quickly.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line shows the writer has not read the question properly.  This essay should focus more on microchipping than different ways to combat kidnappers.  Combating kidnapping is a different essay entirely. <br />

        ANSWER: The technology of the implant must also be reviewed.
        FEEDBACK: This is a neat link, echoing the last line of the previous paragraph and, with the word 'also', opening up a new topic: the technology of the implant.  This is an excellent option.
        ANSWER: In addition, many children have mobile telephones.
        FEEDBACK: This is not a good linking line.  'In addition' doesn't fit here because the previous sentence has been talking about tracking and targeting.  This is not to say that mobile phones don't have a place in the paragraph, just that this sentence doesn't link the themes of targeting and mobiles together very well. 
        ANSWER: There has been an increase in disasters due to corruption, complacency and many other bad developments.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence does echo the theme of the last line of the last paragraph (targeting children carries clear connotations of 'bad developments') but the abrupt change of tone would startle a reader. <br />
        ANSWER: 'My big concern is that kidnappers will simply use tools like knives to get rid of them', said Lauren Weinstein, creator of the privacy forum.

        ANSWER: One variation of a charging system would be for every message to retrieve a small amount of money from the sender's bank account.
        FEEDBACK: This is too abrupt.  We've moved from the benefits of email to variations on charging for email without any link.
        ANSWER: None of the above would have happened so quickly if the email was not free.
        FEEDBACK: This links directly to the content of the previous paragraph and introduces a new topic.  This is the best.
        ANSWER: The email allows people to communicate quickly and directly.  Nowadays it is an important agent of growth.
        FEEDBACK: This option just restates what has been said in the last paragraph, adding nothing new.  Not a good linking line.
        ANSWER: Man is a social animal.  We cannot live alone.  Society is where we flourish, from babyhood right up to the end.
        FEEDBACK: This starts well, echoing the word 'social' from last line of the previous paragraph, but then lingers too long on generalisations about society.

        ANSWER: RFID systems consist of a passive RF transponder and an RF receiver.  Throughout society, they are replacing barcodes.
        FEEDBACK: This linking line seems to move backwards.  We probably need to know what RFID chips are before we know how kidnappers might use them.
        ANSWER: This fear seriously undermines the arguments in favour of microchipping children.
        FEEDBACK: This line refers directly back to the last line of the previous paragraph and moves the argument on.  This is the best.
        ANSWER: An obvious benefit of chip of microchipping children is that it is both cheap and effective.
        FEEDBACK: This line seems to contradict the last line of the previous paragraph.  If kidnappers can locate and remove a chip, how does that make it effective?
        ANSWER: The main issue about tagging is lack of privacy.
        FEEDBACK: If this sentence started with 'However,' it would be fine as a linking sentence.  As it stands, though, the transition is too sudden.

        ANSWER: Invasion of privacy is another argument against the use of wiretapping by a government.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is really just a repetition of the last sentence.  A linking sentence should move the essay on.  This one leaves the essay static.<br />
        ANSWER: Government is a fairly abstract term as there are different forms of government.
        FEEDBACK: <br />
        ANSWER: Yet, even if you accept these arguments, invasion of privacy always emerges as a key factor in the arrest of terrorist suspects. 
        FEEDBACK: 
        ANSWER: Listening in on telephone conversations is more commonly known as wire-tapping.

        FEEDBACK: This line bears no relation to the last line of the previous paragraph.  It brings in a new topic, but not seamlessly.<br />

        ANSWER: Children should not be treated like criminals.
        FEEDBACK: If a question like this is to be asked, the reader must be led towards it.  This does not follow smoothly on from the idea of microchipping being difficult to reverse.

        ANSWER: RFID systems consist of a passive RF transponder and an RF receiver.  Throughout society, they are replacing barcodes.
        FEEDBACK: This linking line seems to move backwards.  We probably need to know what RFID chips are before we know how kidnappers might use them.
        ANSWER: This fear seriously undermines the arguments in favour of microchipping children.
        FEEDBACK: This line refers directly back to the last line of the previous paragraph and moves the argument on.  This is the best.
        ANSWER: An obvious benefit of chip of microchipping children is that it is both cheap and effective.
        FEEDBACK: This line seems to contradict the last line of the previous paragraph.  If kidnappers can locate and remove a chip, how does that make it effective?
        ANSWER: The main issue about tagging is lack of privacy.
        FEEDBACK: If this sentence started with 'However,' it would be fine as a linking sentence.  As it stands, though, the transition is too sudden.

        ANSWER: By this definition, the society of the internet must also be regarded as an open society.
        FEEDBACK: The phrases 'by this definition' (i.e. Karl Popper's definition) and 'open society' relate directly back to the final line of the previous paragraph whilst pushing the argument on.  The link is seamless.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: Observation shows that totalitarian states impose heavy restrictions on internet use. 
        FEEDBACK: This is too abrupt.  Internet use is not the same as internet society, so the link jars.
        ANSWER: Trust can be misplaced by many individuals in on-line relationships.
        FEEDBACK: This uses the word 'individual' but in a completely different context.  The reader would be left puzzled and wondering if a few paragraphs had been missed out.
        ANSWER: Bart Goddy has defined the internet with seven keywords, namely:  open, abundant, interactive, user-controlled and infrastructure independent.
        FEEDBACK: This line, with Goddy's definitions echoing Popper's, might be fine if the next sentence explicitly links Goddy, Popper, 'an open society' and the internet all together and then opens up a new argument.  For example:  'Though couched in technological jargon, this definition of the internet may, at first glance, echo Popper's definition of an open society.  However, the echo is deceptive.'  If this explicit link is not made in sentence 2, then the paragraph transition will not be smooth.

        ANSWER: Solving crimes is a primary, and time consuming, objective of the police and mugshots are one of the investigative tools available.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is too general.  It does use one of the words in the essay title - mugshot - but it simply makes a statement of the obvious.  A marker would not be impressed and might deduct marks.  
        ANSWER: Crime is a growing problem in our society, where every day the situation appears to deteriorate and we are constantly bombarded by news stories of violent crime.
        FEEDBACK: This option has focused on crime, when crime is not the focus of the assignment.   It also makes general and unsubstantiated assertions.   A marker would not be impressed and might deduct marks.
        ANSWER: Expanding the use of facial recognition technology to include the DVLC photo data base and other digitised photo database, of which Flickr is a good example, will add to tensions already voiced over the mugshot databases by the police
        FEEDBACK: This option directly addresses the question set by the assignment.  Even better, through using words also found in the title, the writer has linked his response directly to it.   A marker would find this a highly encouraging start. 
        ANSWER: The government ID card scheme has come in for sustained criticism over the draconian nature of the enforcement required to make it viable.
        FEEDBACK: If the question set was 'Do the draconian measures required to enforce the government's ID card scheme render it unviable?', this option would be good.  But the question set is about the benefits and risks of allowing the police to search large databases of digitised photos, including DVLC and Flickr.   This opening line has nothing to do with that at all and would lose you marks.

    QUESTION 0 


        ANSWER: No.  The fundamental purpose of government is to maintain public order and security.  In my opinion, the issue is really about trust.
        FEEDBACK: An arrestingly combative start, but, alas, though you might respond like this in conversation, it is not a good way to begin an academic essay.  You have certainly been invited by the question to express your view, so nobody is asking you to tone your view down.  However, from the first lines of your response a marker or even just a general reader must be able to tell what the terms of the question were.  This is not possible here.  Nor does the second sentence clarify matters as to the question set, nor the third.  This would not get good marks.
        ANSWER: The monitoring of citizens' telephone conversations by their governments has, throughout the western world, become a bone of contention between the crime prevention and detection lobby and the civil liberties lobby.
        FEEDBACK: This option brings in the terms of the question and succinctly sets out where the essay is going:  i.e. the debate between the crime prevention lobby and the civil liberties lobby.  It is a good, focused start.
        ANSWER: Currently, under UK law, individuals are not prohibited from recording their own communications, providing that the recording is for their own use.
        FEEDBACK: This line probably has a place in the assignment, but not at this point.  It reads rather weakly because, though it echoes the theme of the title, it echoes none of the title's actual terms.   A marker would find it unsatisfactory.<br />
        ANSWER: In the following essay I intend to:  challenge the essay question itself;  broaden the discussion beyond eavesdropping;  lay out the West's traditional position on this subject through Rousseau's 'Social Contract'; analyse whether increased surveillance necessarily leads to greater security;  examine ethical issues surrounding information gathering and finally conclude with my own position on the topic.

        ANSWER: The internet was the latest in a series of huge revolutions in interpersonal communication.  In a few years it became an important part of millions of people's lives.  It is amazing that you can somehow talk with somebody on the other side of the world at 3 a.m. just with a simple application on your laptop.
        FEEDBACK: This opening is too general and unfocused.  It does not remotely reflect the essay title's main theme of society.  It also makes the advent of the internet sound historical rather than something happening here and now.<br />
        ANSWER: Development of internet technology has brought changes in traditional societies and introduced a new kind of society which we often call electronic society.  To explore the way in which traditional societies are changed through the internet, important characteristics of traditional societies will be introduced.
        FEEDBACK: <br />
        ANSWER: The word 'tradition' means an inherited pattern of thought or an action, or a specific practice of long standing.  Therefore, the word 'traditional' is something consisting of or derived from the tradition.  Traditional society is a society which was established in the past and continued its evolution during the course of time.
        FEEDBACK: 
        ANSWER: Traditional societies, i.e. the groups into which people gather for mutual protection and self-interest, have two key characteristics:  a common respect for an agreed set of rules or laws and a code of behaviour to which, though diverse in its particulars, all members of the society can subscribe.   It could be argued that at least in respect of codes of behaviour, the society of the internet is no different.
        FEEDBACK: The first sentence nicely reflects the theme of society but only states the obvious.  The second sentence is superfluous, adding nothing.  If you removed it, it would not be missed.

        ANSWER: Spam is a big problem for email users and generally there have been three suggested solutions:  litigation, filtering and charging.  We will look at all three.
        FEEDBACK: This starts well, but goes slightly off focus.  The question refers directly to a fee changing the behaviour of email users and the possibility of solving the problem of spam through charging.   Litigation and filtering would both come into the section of the essay dealing with spam, but, when placed here, make it look as though the writer has read only one part of the question, and that part not very carefully.  The question is not:  'What would solve the problem of spam?'  The question is 'Do you think charging would solve the problem of spam?'   You must stick to the terms of the question.
        ANSWER: I am going to look at the arguments both for and against paying to send electronic mail over the internet.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is entirely superfluous because it gets us no further into the question set.   It would not be missed if it were deleted so was a waste of time to write. 
        ANSWER: Email is one of the most revolutionary and popular internet services.  Even if it started as a medium of exchanging simple electronic textual messages between users of an MIT project in 1961, today it is probably the most commonly used internet service.
        FEEDBACK: These sentences leave markers clicking their tongues and muttering 'get to the point'.  Opening essays with general statements about how things are in the world denotes an unhelpful wandering around the question instead of getting to grips with it.   <br />
        ANSWER: Email has become the second largest forum for the flow of information in the world, sitting just behind the telephone as the most commonly used form of communication [International Data Corporation (IDC), 2003].  Since there is no cost involved in sending individual emails, the notion of charging is attractive to those looking both to change the behaviour of email users and to solve the problem of generically produced emails known as spam.
        FEEDBACK: <br />
        ANSWER: With email the second largest forum for the flow of information in the world, the idea of solving the related problems of overuse and abuse through charging a fee for what is currently free is certainly attractive.

        ANSWER: With such a vast subject area to discuss, I intend to limit the scope of my discussion to one particular type of email spam known as 'phishing'.
        FEEDBACK: I would say that this limits the discussion too much.  Phishing should be a topic, but not take up the whole debate.
        ANSWER: The idea of imposing a fee, the suggested electronic version of a postage stamp, in order to send email messages is not hypothetical.
        FEEDBACK: This directly echoes the words of the essay title, and makes an interesting claim.  This is the best.
        ANSWER: As part of globalisation, people have been forced to invent new ways to connect with each other.  The introduction of stagecoach routes in the Wild West, for example, has assisted this, as well as the construction of railways.
        FEEDBACK: This is very unfocused and bears no relation to the title of the essay.  It could be cut out without being missed, which is not the hallmark of a good opening line.
        ANSWER: For many years, the traditional way of social interaction between people was face to face.  In the last century it changed and people began to use landlines.

<p> <font size="4">Essay title: Should parents implant microchips into their children to make them easier to identify in case they are lost or kidnapped? Why, or why not?</font><br /></p> <!--EndFragment-->

Every choice has an explanation, so if you find our preferred option quickly, it is still worth browsing through them all.

        ANSWER: In 2002, two 10 year old girls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, were murdered by a horrible criminal.
        FEEDBACK: This would be a possible opening line for a newspaper article designed to shock, but not an academic essay.  It may be arresting, but the phrase 'horrible criminal' is to colloquial.  This opening line would not create a good impression.
        ANSWER: Digital microchips are already implanted into dogs and cats and have been quite useful when pets go astray in the park, are stolen from cars, or to make sure the right dog is in the right class at a pet show.
        FEEDBACK: Had this sentence moved straight to children after 'dogs and cats', it might have worked.  As it is, it is too long and mostly irrelevant. 
        ANSWER: Basically, there are two types of microchip, active and passive.
        FEEDBACK: This opening is too abrupt and the opening 'basically' too colloquial, i.e. a word you might use in conversation, but is not appropriate in an academic essay.
        ANSWER: Before we decide to do something new, we have to ask this question:  'do we have to do this?'
        FEEDBACK: This opening is rather pointless.  The essay title makes clear the questions that need to be answered.  Answering a question with another question adds nothing to the argument.   
        ANSWER: The implantation of Radio Frequency Identity (RFID) tags, or microchips, into children raises issues both ethical and practical.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line goes straight to the point, defining microchips and opening up two areas of debate.  This is the best.

        ANSWER: This essay investigates which is more effective in protecting intellectual property rights in digital media, enforcing copyright law, new technologies or a third mechanism. 
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply restates the essay question, adding nothing.  It is a waste of 24 words!
        ANSWER: Considering this issue, I personally feel that the only way to ensure protection of intellectual property when distributing media on digital mediums such as CD and DVD is to toughen up copyright laws.  
        FEEDBACK: Academic essays should not be personalised with 'I personally feel'.  It is much more professional to say 'this essay will argue'.  However, there is certainly a clear statement made here.  Not the best opening line, but not the worst either. 
        ANSWER: The evolution of digital technology and the internet has opened the way for new uses of digital content and enhanced users' digital entertainment experience.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence reads well but actually, just states the obvious.  As an opening line it performs no useful function.  If it were deleted, it would not be missed.
        ANSWER: A recent, peer-reviewed report (Grant 2009) makes it clear that neither tougher copyright laws nor anti-copying measures, however sophisticated, are ever likely to afford adequate protection for intellectual property rights.
        FEEDBACK: This starts with a confidence-giving citation (the full reference will be in the bibliography).  It echoes the words of the essay title but instead of just repeating them, it uses them to state the writer's thesis.  This is the best option.<br />

    QUESTION 0 'Less' has been used incorrectly here - it should be 'fewer'. Why?
        ANSWER: I disagree, it's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - there are grammar rules that dictate when 'less' should be used and when 'fewer' should be used.
        ANSWER: Because it sounds better.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - there are grammar rules that dictate when 'less' should be used and when 'fewer' should be used.
        ANSWER: Because 'emails' are countable.
        FEEDBACK: Correct - 'fewer' is used with things that are countable (such as 'emails', 'students' or 'bottles', whereas 'less' is used with things that are not, such as 'cheese' and 'weight' (which are measurable, but not countable).
        ANSWER: Because 'emails' aren't countable.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - emails are countable and this is the factor that influences whether 'less' or 'fewer' should be used.

However, that is not clear so an alternative would be preferable in this instance: 'choose to use email', 'choose to email'.

        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - 'generation' is fine here.
        ANSWER: planet
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - 'planet' is fine here.
        ANSWER: computer literate
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - 'computer literate' is fine here.
        ANSWER: preceding
        FEEDBACK: Correct - 'preceding' means 'coming before' so is incorrect in this context as not all previous generations were introduced to computers at an early age.

        FEEDBACK: Correct - succeeding means everything coming after, which is what the author wants to say.
        ANSWER: past
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this doesn't convey the author's meaning at all - precisely the opposite, in fact.

    QUESTION 0 Which is correct, the single or double quotation mark?
        ANSWER: Double.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotations are enclosed in single quotation marks unless they are quotations within quotations.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises for more information.
        ANSWER: Single.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Quotations are always enclosed in single quotation marks unless they are quotations within quotations.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises if you need more information.
    QUESTION 1 Should the writer have got rid of the italics?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The insertion of [sic] shows that these italics were the original author's, and so have been properly kept in.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The insertion of [sic] indicates that the italics were the original author's, and so have been properly replicated.
    QUESTION 2 Is it correct to end the sentence with a comma, if there was a comma in this particular place in the original quote?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not correct.  Every sentence needs to end with a full stop.  The end of this quote should read:  '... its battery'.(1)
        ANSWER: No.

        FEEDBACK: No, it should be enclosed in single quotation marks.  Double quotation marks are reserved for quotes within quotes.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises for more information.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The first quotation should be enclosed within single quotation marks.
    QUESTION 1 Should the second quotation be in italics?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Quotations are never italicised unless italicised in the original source, in which case the word [sic] must be used to show that the italics are the original author's. 
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotations are never italicised unless italicised in the original source, in which case the word [sic] must be used to show that the italics are the original author's.
    QUESTION 2 Is the full stop after the second quotation correctly placed?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not.  When a quotation ends a sentence, the full stop should come between the closing quotation mark and the endnote number.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  When a quotation ends a sentence, the full stop should come between the closing quotation mark and the endnote number.
    QUESTION 3 What is wrong with the endnote number?
        ANSWER: It should be enclosed in brackets and, since the quotation ends the sentence, come after the full stop.
        FEEDBACK: This is correct.
        ANSWER: There's nothing wrong with the endnote number.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  It should be enclosed in brackets and, since the quotation ends the sentence, come after the full stop.

        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If you refer to a fact like this, you must say where you found it.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  If you refer to a fact like this, you need to say where you found it.
    QUESTION 1 How would you reference this fact?
        ANSWER: In a footnote.
        FEEDBACK: In computing science, you would probably use an endnote, not a footnote.  See the footnote, endnote etc. section of this website.
        ANSWER: In an endnote.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  In computing science, you would probably use an endnote.  See the footnote, endnote etc. section of this site.
        ANSWER: In an embedded reference.

    QUESTION 0 What do the superscript numbers in this text mean?
        ANSWER: That the essay writer did some research.
        FEEDBACK: This is not the correct answer.
        ANSWER: The numbers refer to items listed in the bilbiography.
        FEEDBACK: Partly correct, in that they do refer to items in the bibliography, but this is not the correct answer.
        ANSWER: The numbers refer to footnotes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  These numbers refer to the corresponding footnotes, which should be found at the bottom of the page.
    QUESTION 1 Are the superscript numbers correctly placed?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The footnote number should come after the quotation, and if the footnote comes at the end of the sentence, the number should come after the full stop.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Actually, they are correctly placed.  Footnote numbers should come after the quotation to which they refer, or, if the quotation comes at the end of the sentence, the number should come after the full stop.
    QUESTION 2 Are the quotation marks correctly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Direct quotations should be enclosed in single quotation marks. 
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Direct quotations should be enclosed in single quotation marks. 
        ANSWER: No.  Direct quotations should be enclosed in double quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Direct quotations should always be enclosed in single quotation marks.
    QUESTION 3 When are footnotes normally used in computing science essays?
        ANSWER: To give author, date and journal or book references.
        FEEDBACK: This would be right in other subjects, but in computing science, endnotes are usually used for this kind of information.  Footnotes are used to expand on or explain something in the text.
        ANSWER: When the essay writer just wants to show they have done some research.
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't correct.  You can't just stick numbers in to prove you've done some research.
        ANSWER: To expand on or explain something in the text.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. This is how footnotes are usually used in computing science.

    QUESTION 0 Is this an endnote list or a bibliography?
        ANSWER: A endnote list.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not an endnote list.  Endnotes are always numbered.
        ANSWER: This list is a bibliography.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  A bibliography is listed on its own, separate page, and the works listed are not numbered.
    QUESTION 1 In a bibliography, in what order should the referenced works be listed?
        ANSWER: In the order they were read by the writer.
        FEEDBACK: No.  This isn't correct.
        ANSWER: In alphabetical order, using the authors' initials or first names.
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't correct.
        ANSWER: In alphabetical order, using the authors' surnames.
        FEEDBACK: This is correct.  A bibliography is always listed alphabetically, in order of surname.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter, provided all the references are listed.
        FEEDBACK: It does matter, because the point of a bibliography is that it should be easy for a reader to find their way around.
    QUESTION 2 Are these references correctly styled?
        ANSWER: Yes.  
        FEEDBACK: No, they are not correctly styled.  The date of publication should come after the author's name, and the last reference is missing the name of the city of publication, and the name of the publisher.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  They are not correctly styled.  The date of publication should come in brackets after the author's name, and the last reference is missing the name of the publisher.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter how they are styled.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter.  Referencing style has evolved to make it easier for readers to check references out. In this example, the date of publication should come after the author's name, and the last reference is missing the name of the publisher.

    QUESTION 0 What are these references called?
        ANSWER: Bibliography.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  A bibliography is a list of all works consulted (books, journals, websites). A bibliography appears on a separate page and the works not numbered, but listed alphabetically, by author surname. 
        ANSWER: Footnotes.
        FEEDBACK: No, although they are numbered, these are not footnotes.  Footnotes are indicated with superscript numbers in the text.  These bracketed numbers refer to endnotes, and the numbers correspond to references set out at the end of the essay.
        ANSWER: Endnotes.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  This writer has chosen to place reference numbers in the text, and then, at the end of the essay, to list the references corresponding to each number.
    QUESTION 1 Are these web references correctly styled.
        ANSWER: No.  There is no need to put in the entire url or the date accessed.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  It is necessary to put in the entire url, and the date accessed.
        ANSWER: Yes.  The writer has put in the whole url and the date accessed, both of which are needed.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  It is necessary to put in the entire url, and the date accessed.
        ANSWER: Doesn't matter how you style web references.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does.  The point of the reference is to make it possible for the reader to check your source.  To check web sources, it's necessary to have the whole url and the date accessed.

    QUESTION 0 What is wrong with the referencing in this text?
        ANSWER: Nothing.
        FEEDBACK: No, there is something wrong.
        ANSWER: The referencing style is not consistent.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  The writer has used different styles:  footnotes, endnotes and embedded references.  You need to pick one and stick to it.
        ANSWER: There shouldn't be any referencing because there are no direct quotations.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  If you refer to research or quote another person's opinion, even if you don't use their exact words you need a source reference.
    QUESTION 1 Is the embedded reference (Adam, 2002), correctly styled?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  It's not correctly styled.  Remember that the point of referencing is that the reader should be able to look up the source without difficulty, so in this embedded reference, the year of publication should be followed by the page number.  A more complete reference would appear in the bibliography.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not.  Remember that the point of referencing is that the reader should be able to look up the source without difficulty, so in this embedded reference, the year of publication should be followed by the page number.

        FEEDBACK: The semi-colon is not correctly used here.   A colon should be used to introduce a list, even if the list only has two components.
        ANSWER: No.  It's not the correct form of punctuation here.

        ANSWER: No, they're not used correctly.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. Colons introduce lists; semi-colons can be used to divide connected sentences.  In this example, we should have a colon after 'purposes' and a semi-colon after 'in Europe'.

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Colons introduce lists; semi-colons can be used to divide connected sentences.  In this example, we should have a colon after 'purposes' and a semi-colon after 'in Europe'.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter.  Colons and semi-colons have different functions. Colons introduce lists; semi-colons can be used to divide connected sentences.

    QUESTION 0 Are these two colons used correctly?
        ANSWER: Yes. 
        FEEDBACK: You're partly right.  The rule is that you shouldn't use two colons in one sentence.  In this case, the first colon is correct, since what comes after the colon expands on what comes before the colon, i.e. (before the colon) The target market is people from 15-45:  (after the colon) 50% of the population.   This is a good use of the first colon.  <br />
        ANSWER: No.

INTRO  <font size="4">The first area of research was into the Doppler effect. In 1842, Christian Andreas Doppler first asked what happens when the source of a wave and its observer move relative to each other. Originally the 'Doppler effect', as it became known, was used to explain the apparent change in frequency of light being emitted from stars. The cause of this turned out to be the stars' orbit throwing them towards and away from us. This caused the shift. However, the term the 'Doppler effect' is more commonly used when referring to sound waves being emitted by a passing emergency service vehicle. After researching the Doppler effect, it became clear that this effect does not apply to this project. Since both the source (transmitter) and observer (receiver) do not move relative to each other, there is no Doppler shift between them. There are two Doppler shifts relative to the wind: one at the transmitter; the other at the receiver. Thus, the changes in frequency cancel each other out and overall, due to wind speed, there is no change to the frequency of the received signal. </font>

INTRO <font size="4">A helicopter is a frame, propelled by a fan that needs to be powerful enough to support the weight of the frame. Since the materials from which a helicopter is made are very stiff, the main problem is excessive vibration. These vibrations are of different types: imposed vibration; self-exited vibration; bearing whirl; flow excitation from working fluid; rotating friction; unsymmetrical rotor; and synchronous whirl set up by interaction between transverse and torsional modes of vibration. There are different ways of monitoring vibrations, and this project looks at different methods of control or repair. The simplest method of repair would be to replace all the parts that had begun to vibrate. This method has some advantages. There is also a Rotor Track and Balance (RTB) system for adjusting the blades, though this is very labour intensive and costly. Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) can detect problems in the drive train, engines, oil system, and track and balance functions for the rotor system.</font><br />

INTRO <font size="4">2.1.2. PLD<br /><br />The design of the system meant that the team had to choose a PLD which would be able to drive all of the VSYNC and HSYNC values to the display, as well as to manage the transactions to and from the RAM modules. Given the number of lines to manage these two operations alone, the PLD also required a number of communication lines allowing the microcontroller to control accesses to RAM, as well as to initialise the PLD. After much discussion, the team decided that the PLD would need around 106 pins in order to communicate with each of the sub=systems within the product. As well as this, the team would also require a PLD that had a high number of macrocells in order to handle the counts for addressing all of the locations within RAM, for when the display is consuming data. After conducting research into a range of PLDs, the team finally decided to use the EP11270T144C5N from Altera, which is part of the MAX 2 family. This decision was based around the fact that this PLD boasted a high enough pin count for the team's requirements, s well as allowing the team to have a number of spare pins should the system have to be redisigned at any point. As well as this, the PLD boasted 980 macrocells, which was more than enough to count through all the locations within the RAM modules. Another reason the team used this PLD was the presence of demo boards of other PLDs within Altera's MAX 2 range within the department. This allowed the team to familiarise themselves with the Quartus development environment and to generate the VHDL code required for the PLD, as well as perform pin assignment for the design of the PLD.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 This section is all about the same topic - PLDs.  But should it be one paragraph?

    QUESTION 1 If you think it should be divided up, how many paragraphs would you make?
        ANSWER: Two.

        ANSWER: Four.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  For me, paragraph 1 would run from the start down to 'initialise the PLD'.  This describes the decision to use a PLD.  Paragraph 2 would run from 'After much discussion' to 'consuming data'.  This describes the requirements of the PLD that might be used.  Paragraph 3 runs from 'After conducting research' to 'RAM modules'.  This describes the particular PLD the team chose and why they chose it.  Paragraph 4, which begins 'Another reason why' and runs to the end, expands on paragraph 3.  It is in a different paragraph for clarity.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br /><br />Conventional fuels are becoming more expensive as they become scarcer, and burning them causes greenhouse gases which, in turn, leads to global warming. If, in the future, we power our vehicles with electricity, rather than with fuel from the tank, will it be better or worse for the environment? This article considers two issues related to providing an answer: the first is the type of electric vehicles adopted; the second is the source of energy the vehicle uses. Currently, the choice for vehicles is a fairly clear one: conventional, gasoline powered cars; and hybrids which combine orthodox engines with batteries that charge during driving and braking. The Toyota Prius is the first mass-produced example in the latter category. It is able to use fuel more efficiently but is only capable of limited range on electric power alone (1-2 km). It cannot be recharged from the grid. In November 2009, China released the world's first ever mass-produced plug-in hybrid. This is drawing on China's strength as a battery producing nation and the desire to use vehicle manufacture as a level for industrialisation. The Chinese hybrid is not available outside China.<br /><br /><font size="1">adapted from Daborn, ECS3, exam preparation 2010; original text Voelker, <span style="font-style: italic;">IEEE Spectrum</span>, March 2009, pp.42-45, 50-53</font><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 This text is marked as 'Introduction'.  Is it all introduction?
        ANSWER: Yes.  The whole text sets the scene.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Read the text again.
        ANSWER: No.  There are two sections here.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The introduction stops at 'the energy that the vehicle uses'.   That's the end of the introduction.  We should then have another section, titled 'Types of electric vehicle'.  This section starts 'Currently, the choice ...'
    QUESTION 1 Should 'In November 2009' start a new paragraph?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  For clarity, the Chinese hybrid should not be run together with the Toyota Prius.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. For clarity, the Chinese hybrid should not be run together with the Toyota Prius.

INTRO 1. The market for this product is Europe, which is a big market.<br />2. There are plenty of other types of design for buckles, though none have our unique selling point, which is that our buckle can be opened with one finger.<br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Which of these sentences needs specific information to back it up?
        ANSWER: 1 but not 2.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 2 but not 1.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Neither.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Both.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  In sentence 1, we need to know how big the market in Europe is, i.e. how many million people.  Left as it is, the reader would have no idea whether the market was 1,000 or 100,000,000,000.   In sentence 2, we need some examples of buckles already on the market.  This is not just pedantry: it reveals the depth of your research.  Showing this depth is very important for building confidence in your report.  If a marker has confidence in the report, this will be reflected in the mark.

INTRO 1. We made another hole in the mobile part, mostly to decrease the rigidity.<br /><br />2. As you can see from the isometric views of the final concept, it was not very thick. <br /> <br /> 
    QUESTION 0 What word makes sentence 1 rather vague?
        ANSWER: 'another'
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It would be better to say 'a second' or 'a third' or whatever the appropriate number.  But there's another word too.
        ANSWER: 'mostly'
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  'Mostly' implies there was another reason.  It would be important to give the other reason.  If there is no other reason, leave out 'mostly'.  This is not the only word that's vague in this sentence.  
        ANSWER: 'mobile'
        FEEDBACK: No, 'mobile' is fine.  It defines the part.
    QUESTION 1 Does sentence 2 need more written detail if it has a picture?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It needs specific measurements.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  But the measurements might be attached to the picture, in which case that would be enough.  There's no need to repeat information.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That would depend.  If the measurements were part of the picture, then no more written information would be needed.  Information needs to be given only once.  If there were no measurements on the picture, we would need more information in the text.

INTRO <font size="4">1. In helicopter manufacture, there are strict regulations.<br /><br />2. A number of simulations were carried out.</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 What should come after 'strict regulations'?
        ANSWER: One example of a regulation. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think we need a citation, i.e. a numbered, or author/date reference.  This would match a full reference in the reference section of this report.  The reference would show us where to find a full list of regulations. 
        ANSWER: A reference.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think we need a citation, i.e. a numbered, or author/date reference.  This would match a full reference in the reference section of this report.  The reference would show us where to find a full list of regulations.
    QUESTION 1 For sentence 2, do we need to know how many simulations?
        ANSWER: No - it's enough to say 'a number'.  A project team may have forgotten to count them exactly in the lab. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It's part of your work to make sure you note down everything you do.  A quick look through your lab report should tell you exactly how many simulations were carried out.
        ANSWER: Yes.  We should have counted.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. It's part of your work to make sure you note down everything you do.  A quick look through your lab report should tell you exactly how many simulations were carried out.

    QUESTION 0 Which sentence is the fragment?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: No.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: No.  Try again.
        ANSWER: 3.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This sentence is a subordinate clause, i.e. it is adding information to the previous sentence, and does not have a subject or driving verb of its own.
    QUESTION 1 How would you turn the fragment into a whole sentence?
        ANSWER: You can't.  You must leave it out.
        FEEDBACK: No, you can quite easily turn this fragment into a whole sentence.
        ANSWER: By putting a comma instead of a full stop between sentence 2 and 3,  creating one sentence. 
        FEEDBACK: This is a good option.  This attaches the subordinate clause to the main clause and gets rid of the fragment.
        ANSWER: By changing the text to read 'This would combine ...'
        FEEDBACK: This is also a good option.  'This' is the sentence subject, and 'would' is the driving verb.

        ANSWER: None of them are fragments.
        FEEDBACK: No - try again.
        ANSWER: All of them are fragments.
        FEEDBACK: No - try again.
        ANSWER: 1 and 3 are fragments.  2 is a complete sentence.
        FEEDBACK: No. Try again.
        ANSWER: 2 and 3 are fragments.  1 is a complete sentence.
        FEEDBACK: No - try again.
        ANSWER: 1 and 3 are fragments.  2 is a complete sentence.
        FEEDBACK: No - try again.
        ANSWER: 1 and 2 are fragments.  3 is a complete sentence.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  In Sentence 1, the word 'taking' and in sentence 2 the word 'using' are not a driving verbs:  'taking' and 'using' are a type of verb called a gerund - i.e. a verb masquerading as a noun.  A true sentence needs a driving (or finite) verb to tell us when the action was, is being, will be or might be performed.
        ANSWER: 3 is a fragment.
        FEEDBACK: No - 3 is a true sentence.  It has a subject - 'the information' - and a driving verb 'is listed'.  'Is' places the action in time, which is what a sentence needs.
    QUESTION 1 How can we turn these fragments into whole sentences?
        ANSWER: By removing the full stops.
        FEEDBACK: This would make a very clumsy sentence.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Rewriting the sentences making some slight alterations.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I'd rewrite them as follows:  Tests were required to find the MTBF or MTTF and the information gathered was used to explore further causes of failure.  This results are listed in Table 1.

    QUESTION 0 Which sentence is the fragment?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This is a sub-clause, leaving the reader asking 'what was constructed?'  The verbs 'to show' and 'can be' need to be in the same sentence as the subject:  'this'.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 How can we turn the fragment into a proper sentence?
        ANSWER: By leaving it out.
        FEEDBACK: No!  The information it contains is important.
        ANSWER: By joining up the two sentences.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  We could simply say:  This is the scale, constructed to show how each result can be considered.  The subject of the sentence is 'this' and the driving verb is 'is', and the sub-clause follows on easily.

        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  Patents are current.  We need the present tense, IS, here.
    QUESTION 1 Is the past perfect tense, HAS BEEN, the correct tense in sentence 2?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Patents are current and the action of giving a patent is current too, so the verb in sentence 2 should match the verb in sentence 1.  Both need the present tense:  IS.

        ANSWER: HAD BEEN is correct.  
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The pluperfect HAD BEEN doesn't fit here.  It makes it sound as though a state of affairs had existed, when this is not the case.
        ANSWER: The ordinary past, WAS, instead of HAD BEEN.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  WAS makes it sound as though the world economy once had the same patent laws.  This is not the case. 
        ANSWER: WILL BE instead of HAD BEEN.
        FEEDBACK: Using the future tense makes it sound as though a decision to unify world patent law has already been made.  This is not the case.
        ANSWER: The conditional, WOULD BE.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  It WOULD BE beneficial for the world economy to have the same patent laws (but this is not yet the case).
    QUESTION 3 From the choices below, select the best for the second verb - HAD - in sentence 3.
        ANSWER: HAD is fine.  
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We are not talking about the past here.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The future - WILL HAVE.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We are not talking of the future here, but the present.

INTRO After doing further research, I found that motorbikes have become safer over the last 20 years. I looked into what made the motorbike unreliable and found what I think are the parts that could cause the whole system to fail. The first problem I found was engine overheating because it has to be so compact. 
    QUESTION 0 What is the focus of the first sentence?
        ANSWER: The research.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. 'After doing further research' is a subclause, which shows that the major focus of the sentence is yet to come.
        ANSWER: I (i.e. the researcher)
        FEEDBACK: 'I' (or the researcher) is certainly the subject of the sentence.  This is why the sentence is too personal for a formal report.  We need to find the focus of the sentence and make that the subject.
        ANSWER: Motorbikes becoming safer.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is what the sentence is really about.   'Further research' can be the subject so long as the real focus is on motorbike safety.   i.e.  Further research revealed that motorbikes have become safer over the last 20 years.
    QUESTION 1 What is the focus of the second sentence?  
        ANSWER: 'I' (the researcher)
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  'I' (the researcher) is currently the subject of the sentence, but the focus is elsewhere.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The failure of the system.
        FEEDBACK: Failure of the system is one focus, but I think the main focus lies elsewhere.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The unreliability of motorbikes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think this is the main focus, from which all the other comments flow.
    QUESTION 2 What is the focus of the third sentence?
        ANSWER: Overheating engines.
        FEEDBACK: This is certainly important, but I'd say this was a result of the main focus of the sentence.   Try again.
        ANSWER: 'I' (the researcher)
        FEEDBACK: 'I' (the researcher) features in the sentence but is not, nor should be, the main focus.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Problems.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think the focus here is 'the first problem', which is engine overheating.  The numbering of the problem as 'the first' indicates that this problem is the first in a list.
    QUESTION 3 Which is the best, objective rewrite of this passage?
        ANSWER: After doing further research, motorbikes, it seems to me, have become safer over the last 20 years.  They were made unreliable by certain parts, such as the engines overheating because they have to be really pretty small.
        FEEDBACK: This is too chatty.  Phrases like 'it seems to me' and 'really pretty small' have no place in a formal report.  This is not the best choice.
        ANSWER: Further research revealed motorbikes to have become safer in the last 20 years (Fig. 1).  Their previous unreliability was caused by parts failure, for example engines overheating because of their compact size.
        FEEDBACK: This answer is focuses on presenting the information.  There are few superfluous words and everything is reported objectively.  Fig. 1 provides hard evidence.  This text inspires confidence in the writer, and is the best option.

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Alphanumeric displays.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.
    QUESTION 1 In the second sentence, is the phrase 'we found they were' necessary?
        ANSWER: No.  'We found they were' is understood without being stated.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Deleting 'we found that they were' removes only clutter from the text. 
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  'We found they were' is understood without being stated. Deleting this phrase removes only clutter from the text.
    QUESTION 2 What is the focus of the third sentence?
        ANSWER: 'We' (the researchers)
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The VFD display
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  That's the important information in the sentence.
    QUESTION 3 Which is the best objective rewrite of the passage?
        ANSWER: Allphanumeric displays could have been used to create the characters that the 7 segment display could not produce. This was a viable solution and just as cheap. A  VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) was also considered.
        FEEDBACK: This passage is objective (there is no 'I' or 'we') and free from clutter.  It says what it means.  It is a good option.
        ANSWER: Alphanumeric displays could, just as cheaply, have created the characters beyond a 7 segment diplay.  A VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent display) was also considered.
        FEEDBACK: This passage is objective (there is no 'I' or 'we') and has tightened up the original.  This is the best option.

    QUESTION 0 Is this sentence objective?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It is making an objective statement about energy.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The 'I feel', as well as the general nature of the comments, mean they are opinion rather than objective fact.
        ANSWER: No. They are opinion, not objective fact.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Any sentence that includes 'I feel' is unlikely to be objective.
    QUESTION 1 Which of these two sentences turns the text into an objective statement fit for a report?
        ANSWER: Some improvements have been made  and I think they are impressive.  Up to a point, they can help us conserve the energy the earth has left.
        FEEDBACK: This statement is also general. 'Some' improvements doesn't tell us much.  The 'I think' also removes objectivity.  This is not the best option. 
        ANSWER: Improvements in this area are impressive (Fig. 2).  Further improvements will help conserve the earth's remaining gas and oil, currently estimated at (give figures).
        FEEDBACK: This is a very strong statement, with Fig. 2 presumably offering comparative figures.  Providing estimated figures for the world's remaining gas and oil is impressive.  This text is concise, objective and solidly fact-based.  It is a very good option.

    QUESTION 0 Is sentence 1 in the active or passive (objective) voice?
        ANSWER: Passive.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.
        ANSWER: Active.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The passive (objective) voice would read:   The US Army manual was consulted.
    QUESTION 1 Is sentence 2 in the active or passive (objective) voice?
        ANSWER: Active.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.
        ANSWER: Passive.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The active voice would be 'We carried out extensive work ...'.
    QUESTION 2 Is sentence 3 in the active or passive (objective) voice?
        ANSWER: Active.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The passive voice would be: 'After three days, it was found that the vibrations ...'  OR  'After three days, the vibrations were found to have ...'
        ANSWER: Passive.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  The passive voice would read 'After three days, it was found ...' or 'After three days, the vibrations were found to have ...'
    QUESTION 3 Is sentence 4 in the active or passive (objective) voice?
        ANSWER: Active.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  However, since 'the system' is the subject, rather than 'we' or 'I', this sentence does not need to be rewritten in the passive (objective) voice.   'I' or 'we' turn the report into a personal story.  In this case, the active agent is the system.
        ANSWER: Passive.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  You've got confused because 'the system' rather than 'we' or 'I' is the subject.  The active voice is fine in a report if the agent of action is not 'I' or 'we'.  It's the 'I' or 'we' that turn the report into a personal story.  In this case, the active agent is the system.
    QUESTION 4 Is sentence 5 in the active or passive (objective) voice?
        ANSWER: Active.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The subject is 'we' - 'we saw' - so it's in the active voice.
        ANSWER: Passive.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's incorrect.  The sentence is in the active voice.  The subject is 'we', i.e. 'we saw'.  The passive voice would read:  'It was seen that damage had been done which the system could not classify.'

INTRO <font size="4">The projected market is Europe, whose population is approximately 734 million. The targeted age is from 15 -45, or 50% of the population: 367 million people.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the writer certain of these figures, or tentative about them?
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The writer is certain.  He/she confidently asserts that the population IS  734 million (i.e. this is an ongoing fact) and makes the calculation of 50% on this basis.  
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The writer confidently asserts that the population IS 734 million - the present tense underlining this as ongoing fact.  If he/she was uncertain, they might say 'The population MAY BE ...'
    QUESTION 1 What would add credibility to this assertion?
        ANSWER: A citation, i.e. telling us where the figures came from.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  A citation always adds weight to an assertion.
        ANSWER: If all the countries in Europe were listed.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Europe is a recognised entity.  We really just need a citation, revealing the provenance of the figure.

</ol> 
    QUESTION 0 Is statement 1 certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The present tense 'is' implies ongoing certainty.
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The present tense 'is' implies ongoing certainty.
    QUESTION 1 Is statement 2 certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The word 'may' shows that this finding is tentative.
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: Well done.  The word 'may' shows that this finding is tentative.
    QUESTION 2 Is statement 3 certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: Well done.  The present tense - reaches - implies certain, ongoing fact.
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: No - this statement is certain.  We see that in 'reaches'.  The present tense implies certain, ongoing fact.
    QUESTION 3 Is statement 4 certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: No, not this one.  We have the present tense, but look at the word:  suggests.  That flags up uncertainty.  Then, further into the sentence, we get the conditional 'could'.  This is a tentative statement. 
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  We have the present tense, but look at the word:  suggests.  That flags up uncertainty.  Then, further into the sentence, we get the conditional 'could'.  This is a tentative statement.

  <li><font size="4">A recent survey suggested that the public are willing to consider installing solar heating panels largely because Grant (2010) reported that they were inexpensive to operate.</font></li>
  <li><font size="4">A recent survey suggested that the public might be willing to consider installing solar heating panels largely because they may lead to savings in heating bills. </font></li>
</ol> 
    QUESTION 0 Are the findings of 'the recent survey' in statement 1 certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  The clue is in the word 'suggests', but also in the word 'may'.
    QUESTION 1 There is one certainty in statement 1.  What is it?
        ANSWER: That the public are willing to install solar heating panels?
        FEEDBACK: No.  The public MAY be willing ...
        ANSWER: That the survey was carried out satisfactorily.
        FEEDBACK: No.  This is not stated.
        ANSWER: That solar heating panels are inexpensive to operate.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The use of the present tense - ARE - is indicative of certainty.
    QUESTION 2 In statement 2, are the findings certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: This is more complicated.  'Suggests' does not indicate certainty, but the use of the present tense 'the public ARE' does indicate certainty.  This statement is therefore unsatisfactory.  Choose your words and tenses carefully so that there is no confusion about what you are saying.
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: This is more complicated.  'Suggests' does not indicate certainty, but the use of the present tense 'the public ARE' does indicate certainty.  This statement is therefore unsatisfactory.  Choose your words and tenses carefully so that there is no confusion about what you are saying.
    QUESTION 3 How would you define the part of the statement reading 'Grant (2010) reported that they were inexpensive to operate'.  Is Grant's finding: 
        ANSWER: ongoing, generally accepted fact?
        FEEDBACK: I'd say no.  Try again.
        ANSWER: limited to Grant's study?
        FEEDBACK: I'd say yes, because the tense used is the past tense, i.e. they WERE inexpensive to operate.  This implies that the findings are limited to this one study.  If you wanted to turn the findings into ongoing, generally accepted fact, you would use the present tense, i.e. Grant (2010) reported that they ARE inexpensive to operate.
        ANSWER: a tentative finding
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The verb tense used is the past - WERE.  If the finding was tentative, the conditional tense - MIGHT BE or MAY BE - would be used.
    QUESTION 4 Are the findings in statement 3 certain or tentative?
        ANSWER: Certain.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.   The clues are all there:  'suggests', 'might be', 'may lead'.
        ANSWER: Tentative.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The clues are all there:  'suggests', 'might be', 'may lead'.
    QUESTION 5 Which of the following three statements is the most certain?
        ANSWER: A recent survey suggested that the public may be willing to install solar panels if there are savings in heating bills.
        FEEDBACK: Not this one.  There's uncertainty in 'suggested', as well as 'MAY BE' and 'IF'. Try again.
        ANSWER: A recent survey reported that the public are willing to install solar panels since there are savings in heating bills.
        FEEDBACK: Well done.  The certainty is built in right at the start with 'reported' instead of 'suggested'.  Then we have the present tense - the public ARE willing - and another present tense - there ARE savings.  This is as certain as it gets!
        ANSWER: A recent survey reported that the public might be willing to install solar panels since there are savings in heating bills.
        FEEDBACK: Not this one.  The 'MIGHT BE' is tentative.  Try again.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br /><br />We live in a diminishing world, and we need to find sustainable fuels if the planet is to survive. But sometimes we muddle up the terms 'sustainable', 'green' and 'organic'. People feel that 'organic' must be good, and that organic fuels can help relieve energy shortages and climate change. This is questionable. Corn ethanol was heavily subsidised in the US, whilst in Germany rapeseed has been popular, in India jatropha and in Brazil, sugarcane ethanol. All these crops use up land and water - both scarce resources. What can be done? We aimed to find out. <br /></font>

        ANSWER: Yes.  It tells us the subject of the report. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A report is a very specific piece of text.  This abstract is far too general.  It gives a reader no clue as to what's actually inside the report.
        ANSWER: No, it's too vague.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  We have no idea, from this abstract, what the specific goal of the experiment or research was, its methodology or its conclusions. An abstract has a very specific purpose, and this abstract does not fulfil it.
    QUESTION 1 Is the writing style of this abstract appropriate?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It's too chatty.  It's best to avoid the personal 'I' or 'we'.  It's also best to avoid rhetorical questions, e.g. 'what can be done?'  The style here is what we might term 'journalese' in that it would be appropriate for a popular newspaper.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the style is too chatty.  It's best to avoid the personal 'I' or 'we'.  It's also best to avoid rhetorical questions, e.g. 'what can be done?'  The style here is what we might term 'journalese' in that it would be appropriate for a popular newspaper.

        ANSWER: Sentence 2 is the final sentence of the introduction.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The introduction should present what's coming in the report, but not the conclusions.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2 is the final sentence of a paragraph in the body of the report.
        FEEDBACK: It's possible, but being very concise, it's more likely to fit somewhere else.  Perhaps try again?
    QUESTION 2 Is sentence 3, the final sentence of the abstract, the introduction or a paragraph in the body of the report?
        ANSWER: Sentence 3 is the final sentence of the abstract.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  An abstract would be unlikely to end with a statement of fact like this.  An abstract should end with a very concise summary of the most important result(s) of a project, and a very concise recommendation for the future.
        ANSWER: Sentence 3 is the final sentence of the introduction.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  An introduction presents what's to come in a report and would be unlikely to end with a statement of fact like this.  Perhaps try again? 
        ANSWER: Sentence 3 is the final sentence of a paragraph in the body of the report.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is a detail that you'd expect to find in the body of the report.

    QUESTION 0 There are two things wrong with this table of contents.  What are they?
        ANSWER: The confidentiality note, acknowledgments, abbreviations and abstract should have page numbers.
        FEEDBACK: Not necessarily.  If you need a confidentiality note, acknowledgments and a page for abbreviations (you might want a separate page for abbreviations and acronyms if they play a big part in your report), it's not absolutely necessary to give them page numbers so long as they come before the actual start of your report.  You can include the page number of the abstract in your table of contents, but as the abstract is inserted before the table of contents, it's not wrong not to give the abstract page number in the table.  Everything that comes AFTER the abstract, however, must be listed, with the appropriate page number.
        ANSWER: Too much indentation of section numbers.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think it's fine to indent the section numbers, then indent again for sections within sections.  You're right to think about this, though.  If you've got sections within sections within sections, indentation might become a problem.
        ANSWER: Capitalisation is not consistent.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  A professionally laid out table of contents like this is spoiled by inconsistency in capitalisation.  Decide what you're going to put in capitals and stick to it.  When you proof read, check your use of capital letters very particularly as they often creep in, or are left out, inadvertently.  Watchword:  CONSISTENCY
        ANSWER: The page numbers should be in a line.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Make sure your page numbers are properly aligned.  When you read a table of contents, isn't that what you prefer to see?  Somehow, properly aligned page numbers inspire confidence!

Since that time, despite its drawbacks, this system has been used to control freight trains, even as they have become longer and heavier. This report looks at how the airbrake works, the limitations of its operating process and what Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) braking offers. It considers the disadvantages and advantages of the new system and the likelihood that ECP will be implemented.<br /><br /><font size="1">adapted for teaching purposes from Mandelbaum, IEEE Spectrum, 2009, pp.46-49</font><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Would you consider this a good introduction?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Though very concise, it gives enough background to set the scene and lays out very clearly what is contained in the report.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Though very concise, this introduction gives enough background to set the scene and lays out very clearly what is contained in the report.  I think it is a good introduction.
    QUESTION 1 What makes this an introduction rather than an abstract?
        ANSWER: There's no difference.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  An abstract gives a complete overview of a report, i.e. also states (very concisely) the main findings, conclusions and recommendations for further work.  An introduction simply introduces the report.
        ANSWER: An abstract would be shorter.
        FEEDBACK: Not necessarily.  Remember that an abstract gives a complete overview of a report, i.e. also states (very concisely) the main findings, conclusions and recommendations for further work.  An introduction simply introduces the report.  An introduction will often be longer than an abstract but this need not necessarily be the case.  Don't feel you must put unnecessary information into an introduction just to pad it out.
        ANSWER: An abstract does a different job.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  An abstract gives a complete overview of a report, i.e. also states (very concisely) the main findings, conclusions and recommendations for further work.  An introduction simply introduces the report.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br /><br />Conventional fuels are becoming more expensive as they become scarcer, and burning them causes greenhouse gases which lead to global warming. If, in the future, we power our vehicles with electricity rather than with fuel from the tank, will it be better or worse for the environment? This article considers two issues related to finding an answer to this question: first, the type of electric vehicles which are adopted; and second, the source of the energy the vehicle uses.<br /><br />The energy market is hard to predict, and the attraction of plug-in vehicles looks as though it will increase. This is related to lower carbon emissions, smog reduction and security for oil importing nations as the oil price rises and the cost of batteries falls. However, cost and carbon emission from the hybrid plug-in are not the only considerations. The evidence given in this report on secondary emissions might make the purchaser think twice. There are further problems to solve.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size="1">adapted for teaching purposes from John Voelker, IEEE Spectrum, March 2009, pp. 42-45, 50-53</font><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Does this introduction fulfill a reader's expectations in terms of tone and content?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It reads clearly.
        FEEDBACK: It does read clearly, but there's still a problem.  Try again.
        ANSWER: It reads clearly but there's a mismatch between the paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  The second paragraph comes from the conclusion section and has no place in the introduction.  When you write, make sure you think about the section you're writing and make sure the information you're conveying fits properly into that section.
        ANSWER: This reads more like an abstract.
        FEEDBACK: I know what you mean, in that the second paragraph states the conclusions and a nod to future work.  However, an abstract would be crisper, with methodology and less generalised conclusions.  The second paragraph actually comes from the conclusions section of this report, where it sits nicely.
    QUESTION 1 Is the rhetorical question in paragraph 1 suitable for a report?
        ANSWER: Yes, it draws the reader in.
        FEEDBACK: I agree, though be careful.  If you're not confident about your writing, it's best to leave rhetorical questions out.  This report was written by an experienced writer for a journal.  You are writing for an academic audience.  Always remember your reader. 
        ANSWER: No, rhetorical questions should be avoided.
        FEEDBACK: I agree that in an academic environment, it's best to leave rhetorical questions out.  This report, however, was written by an experienced writer for a journal, so is perfectly acceptable.  The key is always to remember what audience you are writing for.

INTRO  <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br /><br />Dashboards, a key feature in racing cars, are under constant review for weight, reliability, ease of use and increased safety. <br />Team A was contracted to build a dashboard display using an OLED screen, and specific functions were specified. The screen was required to display rpm as a green-red bar across the top; a scale of </font><font size="4">O% to 100% on </font><font size="4">the fuel level bar; speed in mph; and gear position. Warning lights were also required to indicate the temperature of the engine and the coolant, low fuel levels and gear change rpm. Additional buttons should facilitate gear changing and allow the user to navigate through the menu system. Lastly, but very importantly, a phone-style cord had to be used to connect to the dashboard to allow easy disconnection of the steering wheel. <br /><br />The success of the project depended on meeting all these criteria. <br /><font size="1"><br /></font> </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Does this introduction fulfill all your expectations as a reader coming new to this report?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's clearly written and sets out the aims of the project.
        FEEDBACK: It does, but I found it a little thin.  As a non-specialist (which many readers will be) I wanted a bit more background about racing car dashboards.  I wondered, for instance, if OLED screens were already in use, and this project was to enhance that use, or whether this was groundbreaking stuff.   I would also have liked more detail on method and perhaps some indication of how the report was divided up.
        ANSWER: No, it had some gaps.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.   As a non-specialist (which many readers will be) I wanted a bit more background about racing car dashboards.  I wondered, for instance, if OLED screens were already in use, and this project was to enhance that use, or whether this was groundbreaking stuff.   I would also have liked more detail on method and perhaps some indication of how the report was divided up.
    QUESTION 1 There is a style flaw in this text.  What is it?
        ANSWER: Colons and semi-colons are wrongly used.
        FEEDBACK: No, they're correctly used here.  See the section on colons and semi-colons on this website.
        ANSWER: The tenses are muddled:  'ARE under constant review'; 'WAS required'
        FEEDBACK: No.  The tenses are correctly used here.  We use the present tense for ongoing things, and reviewing dashboards is ongoing.  We use the past tense for orders which have been issued, so 'WAS' is acceptable here.  The report is telling you what Team A has done, rather than what they are doing now.
        ANSWER: The shortforms, or acronyms (e.g. OLED, rpm) should be written out in full when first used.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Never presume that your reader will understand the shortform or acronym.  A first reference should be written '... using an organic light emitting diode (OLED)' or 'revs per minute (rpm)'.  After this first mention, you can use the acronym alone.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br /><br />I first saw a waterborne monoski on holiday, and used one for recreational purposes. It broke down a lot, which was both annoying and dangerous, and I wondered what tests there could be for monoskis with a view to improving reliability. These tests could be done from databases from manufacturers although a downside was that databases were often quite out of date and had tested monoskis made of old materials. Although many other pieces of recreational equipment are similar to the monoski, I concentrated only on reliability testing for monoskis. In this short report, I define reliability and offer some ideas, both theoretical and practical, about reliability testing for monoskis.<br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the tone of this introduction what a reader would expect from an engineering report?
        ANSWER: Yes - it may be chatty, but it's quite clear.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The 'chattiness' makes the report vague.  What is meant by 'a lot' or 'quite out of date'?  An engineering report is useless if it's not specific.
        ANSWER: No.  It is too informal.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The 'chattiness' makes the report vague.  What is meant by 'a lot' or 'quite out of date'?  An engineering report is useless if it's not specific.
    QUESTION 1 Is it acceptable to use the first person in an introduction like this, since the project was generated by a personal experience?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  In an engineering report, it's best to use the impersonal form, i.e. Waterborn monoskis are used for recreational purposes.  The personal 'I' is not entirely wrong, but it sets an informal tone which is often not helpful to either writer or reader.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.   In an engineering report, it's best to use the impersonal form, i.e. Waterborn monoskis are used for recreational purposes.  The personal 'I' is not entirely wrong, but it sets an informal tone which is often not helpful to either writer or reader.
    QUESTION 2 If you had to mark this introduction out of 3, with 3 being the best mark, how much would you give it?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, I would too.  The use of 'quite out of date', 'a lot' and other colloquialisms, together with the use of the first person, seriously undermines this introduction.
        ANSWER: 2. 
        FEEDBACK: I'd say that was generous.  There is information in this introduction, but it's undermined by the vague colloquialisms, e.g. 'quite out of date', and the use of the first person.
        ANSWER: 3.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree entirely!  There is information here, but the vague nature of some of the statements - what does 'quite out of date' really mean? - undermines the whole introduction.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction<br /><br /></font><font size="4">'The motorcycle is the area that has changed the most in the last 100 years', according to NSW Inc. Looking further into this task, I found that motorbikes have become a lot safer from tyres and brakes to suspension, especially in the last 20 years. Many people say that motorbikes are dangerous but it's not necessarily the motorbike itself that's dangerous. The environment and the person driving could be the danger factor. 'Vehicle failure accounted for less than 3% of motorcycle accidents' according to the University of Southern California Traffic Safety Centre. So the reliability of motorbikes is good but not great. So looking into what I think are the main factors in unreliability, I think these are the main factors that cause a motorbike to fail: the engine, the brakes and the suspension.</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the tone of this introduction what you might expect from an engineering report?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Though it may be a bit chatty, it's clear what the writer is writing about.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the use of the personal 'I' has set the report off on too informal a route.  By the end of this paragraph, though we know the writer's opinion, we still don't know what the project aims are. 
        ANSWER: No.  It seems to wander.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  At the end of this paragraph, we still don't know the project's aims.  In a short report, this would be a waste of words.
    QUESTION 1 There is something wrong with the quotation that begins this introduction.  What is it?
        ANSWER: The writer should use double quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: No.  Single quotation marks are correct for a direct quotation.  Double quotation marks are reserved for a quote within a quote.
        ANSWER: The figure 100 should be written in text, i.e. as 'one hundred'.  
        FEEDBACK: No.  If it was figures in the quotation, it needs to be figures here.
        ANSWER: The writer should have written out NSW in full as the reader may well not know what it stands for.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  If you have a shortform or acronym, you need to write it out in full the first time it is used.  After the first time, it can be used alone.  You may know, but I do not, what NSW Inc. stands for.  The web has countless NSWs.
    QUESTION 2 Is it acceptable to use phrases like 'a lot safer' in any part of an engineering report?
        ANSWER: Yes, it's fine to use generalities in an introduction because you'll move to specifics in the body of the report.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  You must be specific right from the start.
        ANSWER: No, it's never fine to use generalities.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  You need to be specific from the beginning of the report right to the end.

        ANSWER: No. It's too chatty.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The phrases 'a few unresolved issues'; 'for a start'; and 'a better circuit' are too vague for a report.  Always include examples. 
        ANSWER: It is a little chatty, but fine for the conclusions or discussion section.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Chattiness is never good in a report.  Also, the phrases 'a few unresolved issues'; 'for a start'; and 'a better circuit' are too vague.  It will nearly always be better to include an example, however brief.
    QUESTION 4 Which sentence fits better into a conclusion/discussion, sentence 7 or sentence 8?
        ANSWER: Sentence 7.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is a real conclusion, even though it's rather an obvious one.  However, sentence 8 is vague.  If you want to talk about success, make a list of successes.  In some reports, successes might be listed with bullet points.
        ANSWER: Sentence 8.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence is pretty vague.  If you want to talk about successes, we need a list.

INTRO <font size="4">Due to a number of setbacks, the team felt there were a lot of areas in the main design of the project that could be enhanced by future work. The first piece of work would be to conduct more testing on the final test board. At the time of writing, we are still unaware of the problems that might exist with the final board. Therefore, in order for any improvements to be made to the board, the stability of the current board has to be ensured first.<br /><br />As well as this, future designers would need to optimise the area of the PCB in order to mount the system in the steering wheel. This may require the sub-systems to be divided across multiple boards with appropriate inter-board connections. <br /><br />Optimising the storage of graphics in the Microcontroller's FLASH would be useful, although it was recognised that an external FLASH would currently slow the system. Work should be done on this. <br /><br />A specialised microcontroller would cut down on the number of devices required. <br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the writing style of this text suitable for an engineering report?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I would say 'nearly' rather than 'yes'.  Colloquialisms have crept in, for example 'a lot of areas'.  What is 'a lot'? But the text improves as it continues.  Being concise, as in the last two items, is always commendable.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree, although I would say the tone of the text is nearly right rather than absolutely right.   Colloquialisms have crept in, for example 'a lot of areas'.  What is 'a lot'? But the text improves as it continues.  Being concise, as in the last two items, is always commendable.
    QUESTION 1 Does it inspire confidence that the final test board had not been tested?
        ANSWER: That doesn't matter.  It can be tested in the future.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  As a non-specialist reader (which some of your readers will be), it feels disappointing that the test board was not tested.  Either give very good reasons for this (running out of time doesn't seem a particularly good reason to miss out something so crucial) or manage your time better so that this crucial stage is incorporated.
        ANSWER: It doesn't inspire confidence.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  As a non-specialist reader (which some of your readers will be), it feels disappointing that the test board was not tested.

    QUESTION 2 Do we need PCB to be written out in full?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree that when the acronym PCB first appears, it needs to be written out in full.  In the conclusions section, however, when the term will have been used throughout the report, it's not necessary.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree  When the acronym PCB first appears, it needs to be written out in full.  In the conclusions section, however, when the term will have been used throughout the report, it's not necessary.

<p> If more time had been spent familiarizing the designer with Plastics Advisor 8 and the mold design tools in Solid Works, the final stages of the design process would have been smoother. The undercut that caused problems was very obvious and should have been noticed earlier, either from the prototype or just in the CADdesign. That could have been picked up when the first rough designs were produced rather than waiting until detailed design work had been completed. It would also have been useful to step back from the process and conduct an overview rather than concentrating on each separate part of the process. </p> <!--EndFragment--> 
    QUESTION 0 Here is the conclusion section of a report, and the recommendations.  Is the tone of these recommendations suitable for a Design Report?  
        ANSWER: No.  It should be more about the product, less about what went wrong.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is a design report and the writer has successfully combined the personal lessons learned with the design itself.   The solid text 'recommendations' paragraph is also a nice contrast with the conclusion's bullet points.  A reader would appreciate this change in style.
        ANSWER: Yes, it reads well.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is a design report and the writer has successfully combined the personal lessons learned with the design itself.   The solid text 'recommendations' paragraph is also a nice contrast with the conclusion's bullet points.  A reader would appreciate this change in style.

        ANSWER: It's too short.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It's a good length, saying exactly what it needs to say.
        ANSWER: The 'most' in the first line, as in 'most points' should be more specific.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  To perfect this, 'most' would be changed to a specific figure, e.g. 13 out of 15, or 95%, or whatever was appropriate.

        ANSWER: There should be no italics.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Book titles and journal titles are italicised.
        ANSWER: The Product Information Guide should be listed ahead of the journal.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not it.  References should be listed in alphabetical order by author surname (the first author in multi-author works).  Works without a specified author should be slotted in alphabetically by title.
        ANSWER: There is an inconsistency in the order.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  The publication date in the first reference comes after the authors and in the second reference comes at the end.  Either is correct, but BE CONSISTENT.
    QUESTION 1 What are all the figures at the end of the first reference?
        ANSWER: 924-933 are the span of the article.  930 is the specific page from which the quotation is taken.

The literature on classroom leadership has suffered from other problems. There has been a great deal of conceptual confusion about the dimensions of teacher behaviour to be examined. Different investigations have used a variety of variables such as authoritarian-democratic, dominant-integrative, initiating structure-consideration, directiveness-warmth, task oriented-supportive and teacher structuring praise. <br /></font>

If it's essential to immediate understanding, keep it in the body of the text.
    QUESTION 2 Is statement 3 true or false?
        ANSWER: True.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Sometimes an appendix is a figure or a graph.  When deciding where to place material, keep the reader in mind.  If you, as a reader, would find the material, whether calculations, plain information or a figure or graph, distracting rather than immediately informative, then attach it as an appendix.  If it's essential to immediate understanding, then keep it in the body of the text.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Sometimes an appendix is a figure or a graph.  When deciding where to place material, keep the reader in mind.  If you, as a reader, would find the material, whether calculations, plain information or a figure or graph, distracting rather than immediately informative, then attach it as an appendix.  If it's essential to immediate understanding, then keep it in the body of the text.
    QUESTION 3 Is statement 4 true or false?
        ANSWER: True.
        FEEDBACK: I think you're right.  In the main, it's the result of calculations that's important to your project.  The calculations, which should also be shown, are usually best shown in an appendix.
        ANSWER: False.

The Amplifier was then connected to the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) input of <span style="font-weight: bold;">an Arduino microcontroller board</span>. <br /> 
    QUESTION 0 You will have to think hard here, but one of the items marked in bold needs a figure in the body of the text and the other, also marked in bold, needs further explanation that should appear in an appendix.  Can you tell which one needs which type of additional information?
        ANSWER: The 'module in the cab unit' needs a figure as illustration.  The 'Arduino microcontroller board' needs an  appendix.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A module seems easy to understand, though it would be good to see what the module looked like, so a figure would be appropriate.  An Arduino microcontroller board is unusual.  The reader may not have met one before.  Its genesis and workings need further explanation.  Such an explanation would interrupt the flow of the text unless the whole project was actually about Arduinos.  If it's not, then the information about them should be placed in an appendix.

    QUESTION 0 Is the colon in this sentence properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A colon should introduce a list, or expand on the information that precedes it.  If a colon is correctly used, you can usually swap it for the phrase 'that is to say'.  In this case, a new topic has been introduced.  Topic 1 is the effects of Fascism.  Topic 2 concerns historians.  I think these sentences would be better separated by a full stop.

    QUESTION 0 Is the semi-colon correctly used in sentence 1?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  In sentence 1 we have two sentences closely linked.  Each could stand alone, but a semi-colon helps the text to flow.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism and creationism fundamentally reject the modern world, and this rejection in itself describes one major problem of the modern world:  a sense of alienation.  This sense is witnessed by ...
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines fulfil one of the major criteria of a good opening line:  they grab the author's attention.  I like the fact that we're also to get an example early on.  A powerful opening and the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Modern society has many problems and the literature on fundamentalism and creationism tells us a great deal about those problems.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the question.  It tells us nothing.  Nor does it open the essay up.  We wouldn't miss this line if it was removed from the essay.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism is 'strict adherence to a specific set of theological doctrines typically in reaction against the theology of Modernism' (Wikipedia 2011).
        FEEDBACK: Although beginning your essay with a defining quotation is a good technique, wikipedia is not a reliable source of information.  For this reason, this is a poor choice.

        ANSWER: This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the terms of the question.  Nothing is added and it does not open up the essay in any way.  If you removed this line, the essay would be none the poorer.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Marx and Engels both saw communism as a logical step in societal evolution but if communism was the next step forward from industrial capitalism, then Russia would not have been either Marx or Engels' choice for the experiment.  As they ask in the preface to the 1882 edition of the Communist Manifesto ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines are informative but opening lines need to seize the essay question directly.  All this information may be useful within the essay, but as opening lines these are unhelpful.
        ANSWER: The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1921 as a direct result of a collapse in production following an international war and a internal revolution.  The reasons for its abandonment are more complex, but an analysis of these reasons shows not just why the NEP lasted only seven years, but also how its own structure meant that failure in the long term was inevitable.

        ANSWER: Throughout the ages, women have been seen as the 'weaker' sex.  In ancient Greece, for example, long hailed as an example of democracy, women were not seen as equal to men.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines are much too general.  They might do for an article in a tabloid newspaper but simply waste words in an academic essay.  In an academic essay, you need to seize the subject from the very start. Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: That any public policy in 21st century should have to address specifically the needs of women shows that public policy directed at women's equality has been ineffective.  However, this may be more to do with women's expectations than public policy failure.  For example, ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines certainly grab the reader's attention.  Confident and controversial, they would make any reader want to read on.  The best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Women have a pretty rough ride as I know from experience.  In 2010, my mother is still not being paid the same as her male counterparts.  Public policy is pretty ineffective if it cannot even guarantee the same wage for the same job.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too anecdotal and colloquial.   With a few tweaks - for example using the experience of the writer's mother in a more objective way, with hard evidence attached - they could be transformed into lines suitable for an academic essay.  As they stand, however, these lines are not the best choice here.

        ANSWER: Urbanisation, attitudes towards health, poor diet, poor housing and environmental degradation were all challenges to public health in the 19th century.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line gets straight to the point.  The best option here.
        ANSWER: During the 19th century, many things changed in Britain and across the whole of Europe.  
        FEEDBACK: This sentence adds nothing to the essay, simply repeating the terms of the question.  We wouldn't miss this opening line if it were deleted.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Throughout history, nations have faced challenges in public health, but it is only within the last three hundred years that public health has become an issue of real concern.  In 14th century, for example, people were certainly worried about catching the plague and some containment policies were put in place.  However,  you could hardly call this a start to overcoming public health challenges.
        FEEDBACK: These lines tell us something, but they don't get straight into the question.  In an academic essay in Social and Political Science, you should not waste time on a potted history unless it's a necessary part of the answer to the essay question.  This is not the best option on offer here.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Essay question:<br /><br /></font>How, in some European societies, did World War I create favourable preconditions for the emergence of Fascist parties?<br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: There is a general consensus amongst those who study World War 1 that it left a lasting impact on world politics.  It was, after all, the Great War; the War to End All Wars.  Ten million men lost their lives and it is generally agreed that the world was never the same again.
        FEEDBACK: These lines start well, but the second line begins to drift.  Make sure you stick firmly to the question in your opening lines.  First impressions are very important.
        ANSWER: Three conditions are necessary for the emergence of fascism: nationalist ideology; a charismatic leader and a political environment which provides democratic legitimacy.  By looking closely at the legacy of World War I, it is possible to identify certain preconditions which gave birth to these conditions, and this essay will explore these preconditions with particular reference to Germany and Spain.
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear and confident start.  The reader learns something important from the first sentence, and the second sentence provides an essay map.   These lines are the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: World War I (1914-1918) was a conflict caused by a number of factors, but the immediate catalyst was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by a Serb.  This assassination set in motion a war of mass carnage, which dragged on until finally ending with Germany's humiliation at the Treaty of Versailles.
        FEEDBACK: Nothing here is wrong - except that by the end of these lines a reader who had not seen the question would have no idea what the essay was supposed to be about.  There is no mention of fascism.  Every fact in your first lines must be relevant to the essay question.  However well written they are, if your first lines are just a wander through history, they'll gain you no marks.

        ANSWER: It is clear, then, that one of fascism's most devious strengths is its principle of adapting and gathering   to itself other creeds, even ones seemingly inimical to its beliefs. Fascism is, therefore, not necessarily anti-Christian because it is not, by necessity, anti anything at all.
        FEEDBACK: These are strong closing lines that come to a thought-provoking conclusion.  These are the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Unfortunately, as this essay has proven, we do not as yet fully understand the relationship between fascism and Christianity.
        FEEDBACK: The statement made by these concluding lines may be true but the lines leave the reader with a sense of anti-climax.  The essay question asked for an answer.  If there is no answer, try not to finish your essay with a sentence beginning 'unfortunately', since this leaves a clear impression of defeat.  These lines are not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: In addition, we might remember that the term 'clerical-fascism' is an oxymoron, which leaves us with the question:  were these Catholic states fascist at all?

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: As has been seen, diversity of crops, a more prosperous economy and famine relief schemes were key to Scotland avoiding famine in the 1840s. In Ireland, failure to address any of these issues in time meant that famine was an inevitable result of potato blight.  When combined with the policies of the British government, mass starvation was unavoidable.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines briefly recapitulate the themes of the essay in order to give a satisfactory answer to the essay question. These are the best lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: There were also other causes of the famine, for example landlords mismanaging their lands, but these do not truly account for the differences in the effects of famine between Scotland and Ireland.
        FEEDBACK: These lines rather drift to a halt, and it is always a mistake to bring in new ideas right at the end of an essay.  If there are topics you cannot include for space reasons, but you want to make reference to them, the introduction is the right place to mention them, not the conclusion.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: It was a truly terrible time for the Irish and the British government should apologise and hang its head in shame.
        FEEDBACK: You may think this, but an academic essay is not the place to air such views unless specifically asked to do so by the essay question.  Not the best choice here.

        ANSWER: Housing policy plays an important role in people's mental health and so policies should be put in place that reflect this.
        FEEDBACK: Be careful of the question:  this one asks specifically about physical health.  Make sure your conclusion fits with the essay question.   Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Where you live is quite important and people in charge of housing policy have a duty to remember this.
        FEEDBACK: Apart from the colloquialism (what does 'quite' really mean?), this concluding line is fine, if a little uninspiring.  It's not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: As has been demonstrated, a three-pronged approach to health through public policy has dramatic effects.  Housing is a key part of this approach and if anybody queries the reason why housing policy should always seek to make a contribution towards improving people's physical health, the answer is simple: the contribution actually works.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines have a good ring to them.  Confident and focussed, they leave a good impression.  These lines are the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Poland's not out of the woods yet. 
        FEEDBACK: The expression 'out of the woods' make this concluding line too colloquial for an academic essay.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Until Poland's organs of regional government achieve independence from central government, further development is not possible.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good, solid concluding line because it leaves the reader with something to think about and a sense of closure.  This line is the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: As has been shown, it is difficult to assess exactly why it has been so difficult for Poland to implement a coherent regional policy.  Perhaps things will be clearer in a few more years.
        FEEDBACK: These are unsatisfactory concluding lines.  Even if a definitive answer is not possible, some conclusions should be drawn.  Not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: I think that ethnographers' biggest limitation is understanding other cultures.
        FEEDBACK: This line is too personal (avoid 'I think') and although it makes a statement, feels rather flat.  Not the best option here. 
        ANSWER: The possible limits of anthropological engagement with different cultures and societies?  Understanding.
        FEEDBACK: Including a rhetorical question in your concluding lines smacks of journalism rather than academia.  If you have a statement to make, make it.  Avoid the rhetorical question.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: From all the examples given, one thing is clear:  ethnographers' biggest limitation is not one of engagement with different cultures and societies but one of understanding, and whether it is possible to break through this barrier is highly doubtful.
        FEEDBACK: This is an example of a good concluding line: it does not provide a definitive answer but still says something definite, i.e. that engagement is limited by understanding.  This answers the question set in the essay title and leaves the reader with something positive to think about.  It is the best option here.

        ANSWER: The concept of globalisation is complex.  It does not simply mean that the world is one marketplace.
        FEEDBACK: If you have taken the phrase 'one marketplace' from a source, you must acknowledge that source.  If, however, this idea is your own thought, you don't need hard evidence here since this is your opinion.  You will, though, want to prove your point and this will usually involve examples.
        ANSWER: Globalisation has brought with it a new kind of crime, in which international financial institutions are charged with not supporting poor nations to uphold, for example, globally accepted safety standards.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion does need evidence. Appropriate evidence might include the 2002 sinking of the Senegalese ferry, as analysed by Rothe, Muzzatti and Mullins (2006).  
        ANSWER: The western media, with its wide reach, contributes to the sense that we are all connected.
        FEEDBACK: Although telling examples are always helpful, this kind of general assertion does not need specific evidence.  However, if you are paraphrasing lines you found in a source, you must acknowledge the source both in the text and in the bibliography.

        ANSWER: Illegal arms trafficking compromises public safety.
        FEEDBACK: This general assertion is a topic for a paragraph (which would include examples) rather than something that requires immediate hard evidence.

        FEEDBACK: This type of statement is never acceptable in an academic essay.  How much is 'huge'?  We need to know that 600 kg of 93% pure heroin was discovered, with a street value of about $20 million - and this must be properly referenced.

        ANSWER: The Leeds study revealed that walking trips to the main food store increased after retail intervention.
        FEEDBACK: Evidence is certainly needed here, for example '... walking trips to the main food store increased from 12.3% to 30.8% after retail intervention (Wrigley et al. 2004)'.
        ANSWER: A 'food desert' intervention study in Leeds included focus groups as a major part of its design.
        FEEDBACK: This statement does not need specific evidence, although we need a reference for the study, e.g. (Wrigley et al. 2004).  It is highly likely that evidence from the focus groups would be included in the essay.
        ANSWER: Tesco is increasing its market share as Morrison's share is slipping.
        FEEDBACK: Assertions about figures and statistics always need hard evidence to back them up.  This assertion should be followed by:  According to Kantar Worldpanel (in Daily Telegraph 2010a) December 2010 saw Tesco's market share increase to 30.7% from 30.6% whilst Morrison's dipped from 12.1% to 12%.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: The Irish famine was precipitated by potato blight.
        FEEDBACK: This is a topic sentence, but does not require hard evidence in the same way as, for example, a statement about how many people died in the famine.
        ANSWER: Before famine struck, adult males in Ireland consumed massive numbers of potatoes each day.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention numbers, you must give numbers, not rely on colloquialisms like 'massive'.  A better sentence would be: Before famine struck adult males in Ireland consumed on average 70 potatoes each day. <br />
        ANSWER: In conclusion, it is clear that these are the reasons Scotland avoided the famine which was so disastrous for their neighbours across the Irish sea.
        FEEDBACK: This would be followed by a reference, formatted in the appropriate style (Harvard or footnote system).

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.
        FEEDBACK: The phrase 'found many ways' clearly indicates a need for evidence.  You cannot say 'many ways' and not produce at least two fully referenced examples of those ways.  You might, for example, say:  Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.  For example, she undermined relations between cabinet colleagues and appropriated the powers of her Chancellor of the Exchequer (Smith in Rhodes & Dunleavy 1995).
        ANSWER: Thatcher became the British prime minister following the 1979 general election.
        FEEDBACK: This is a well known and incontrovertible fact so doesn't need proof.
        ANSWER: In 1979, there was a big percentage swing to the Conservatives and they won many more seats than Labour.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention percentages and numbers, you need to provide exact figures, not just concepts like 'big' or 'more'.  Here, we need to know that the percentage swing was 5.2% and that the Conservatives won 339 seats against Labour's 269 (BBC 1997).

<p class="MsoNormal">There can be no doubt that in Charlotte Brontes <span style="font-style: italic;">Jane Eyre </span>and in John Donnes 'Batter my heart, three-person'd God', the relationship between the self and religion is a prominent one.</p> 
    QUESTION 0 There are two apostrophe errors in this sentence. What should the two affected words look like?
        ANSWER: three-persond, relation'ship
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the apostrophe in 'three-person'd' indicates that there is a letter missing; no apostrophe is required within the word 'relationship'.
        ANSWER: Brontes', Donnes'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - there is only one Bronte and only one Donne, so the possessive apostrophe should not go after the final 's' (which in this case suggests plurals).
        ANSWER: Bronte's, Donne's
        FEEDBACK: Correct - these apostrophes are needed to demonstrate that 'Jane Eyre' was written by Bronte, and 'Batter my heart, three-person'd God' was written by John Donne.
        ANSWER: There aren't any errors.
        FEEDBACK: Yes there are - two apostrophes are needed to make this sentence grammatically correct.

    QUESTION 0 There is an apostrophe error in this sentence - which of the following do you think is the correct version of the word that currently contains the error?
        ANSWER: belief's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this is the plural of belief: apostrophes are never used to indicate plurals.
        ANSWER: extremes'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this is the plural form of extreme, and does not need a possessive apostrophe (which this one is) - the extremes aren't possessing anything in this sentence.
        ANSWER: individual's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this is the plural of individual: apostrophes are never required to make a plural.
        ANSWER: Janes'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - there's only one Jane, whereas this suggests that there are lots of Janes with an undefined faith.
        ANSWER: Jane's
        FEEDBACK: Correct - there is one Jane who possesses an undefined faith, so the apostrophe is essential here. For more information on how to use apostrophes, click on the blue question mark near the top of the page.

    QUESTION 0 There is an apostrophe error in this sentence - which of the following do you think is the correct version of the word that currently contains the error?
        ANSWER: characters'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the writer is only talking about one character (as indicated by the use of 'side' rather than 'sides') so the possessive apostrophe should not go after the 's'.
        ANSWER: character's
        FEEDBACK: Correct - this now indicates that the side belongs to one character.
        ANSWER: convey's
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - apostrophes are never used in verb formation. This is the third person singular form of the verb 'to convey'.
        ANSWER: conveys'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - apostrophes are never used in verb formation. This is the third person singular form of the verb 'to convey'.

    QUESTION 0 This sentence is badly punctuated - a colon can be used to make it a lot easier to read. Which of the following options do you think works best?
        ANSWER: Overall: Hamlet is very influenced by the anticipation of his uncle's death, It is something which he wants to control.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the colon shouldn't be put here. A colon is used to introduce more information, or a list.
        ANSWER: Overall Hamlet is very influenced by the anticipation of his uncle's death, It is something: which he wants to control.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - a colon should not be put here. A colon is used to introduce more information or a list. What goes before should be a complete sentence; what follows can be a fragment or a complete sentence.
        ANSWER: Overall Hamlet is very influenced by the anticipation of his uncle's death: it is something which he wants to control.
        FEEDBACK: Correct - here the colon is being used to provide more information about why Hamlet is influenced by this anticipation. Also note that the capital letter on 'It' has been made lower case - this is the preferred style in British English. American English prefers the capital letter after a colon.

<p><font size="4">Like Herbert, he makes the distinction between the body and the soul - whilst 'our best men with thee do go', their bones remain and their soul is delivered to heaven.</font></p> 
    QUESTION 0 This sentence works quite well with a dash, but one of the following options works better - which one?
        ANSWER: Like Herbert, he makes the distinction between the body and the soul: whilst 'our best men with thee do go', their bones remain and their soul is delivered to heaven.
        FEEDBACK: Correct - putting the colon here means that how he makes the distinction follows nearly on from the statement that he makes the distinction.
        ANSWER: Like Herbert, he makes the distinction between the body and the soul; whilst 'our best men with thee do go', their bones remain and their soul is delivered to heaven.
        FEEDBACK: Possibly - the semi-colon works reasonably well here. It links two closely-related sentences, but perhaps does not indicate that the second explains the first.
        ANSWER: Like Herbert, he makes the distinction between the body and the soul. Whilst 'our best men with thee do go', their bones remain and their soul is delivered to heaven.
        FEEDBACK: Probable - the full stop could be used here, but it does provide a very definite break. The natural flow encouraged by a different punctuation mark might be preferable.

    QUESTION 0 The punctuation in this sentence needs to be changed in order for the sentence to be easier to read and understand. Which of the following changes do you think is best?
        ANSWER: change the semi-colon to a colon; change all the commas to semi-colons, insert a semi-colon after 'times'
        FEEDBACK: Correct - this changes will make the sentence more obviously a list, with the semi-colons clearly separating each item in the list.
        ANSWER: No changes
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - some changes are needed to make it clear that this is a list.
        ANSWER: Change the semi-colon to a comma
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this would make the sentence more confusing. It's necessary to change the punctuation marks throughout the sentence in order to demonstrate that this is a list.

<p><font size="4">Whoever has Daisy, has the upperhand.</font></p> 
    QUESTION 0 This sentence contains a comma, but the comma hasn't been used correctly. Which of the following alternatives should the writer have used instead?
        ANSWER: Whoever has, Daisy, has the upperhand.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - Daisy is a key element of this sentence and shouldn't be bracketed using commas.
        ANSWER: Whoever has Daisy has the upperhand.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. 'Whoever has Daisy' is the subject of the verb 'has', while 'the upperhand' is the object. No comma is needed in the sentence - it works best without.
        ANSWER: Whoever, has Daisy has the upperhand.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - it's critical that 'Whoever has Daisy' isn't separated by a comma - the phrase forms the subject of the verb.

    QUESTION 0 There's a comma missing from this sentence - where would you put it?
        ANSWER: After 'George Herbert'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the two commas in the sentence need to enclose the names of 'the two poets'.
        ANSWER: After 'John Donne'
        FEEDBACK: Correct - this will put the names of the two poets between two commas. This is extra information that clarifies which two poets are being talked about. If you removed the text between the two commas, the sentence would still make sense: 'The two poets were clergymen who wrote...'
        ANSWER: After 'clergymen'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - 'who wrote religious...' is a defining clause - it defines which particular clergymen they were. Commas are never used before a defining clause.

    QUESTION 0 The writer has used a comma to separate two complete sentences here. Which punctuation mark would be more appropriate?

        ANSWER: semi-colon
        FEEDBACK: Correct - the semi-colon would work well here, with the second sentence providing information about how Helen changes Jane's perception of the world.
        ANSWER: full stop
        FEEDBACK: Correct - the full stop would work well here, providing a definite break between the two sentences. 
        ANSWER: dash
        FEEDBACK: Correct - the dash would work well here, with the second sentence providing information about how Helen changes Jane's perception of the world.

<p>So the relationship between him and Ophelia, is not a mystery.</p> 
    QUESTION 0 What would you do with the comma in this sentence?
        ANSWER: leave it where it is 
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - at the moment, it's putting an unnecessary break between the subject of the sentence ('the relationship between him and Ophelia') and the verb 'is'.
        ANSWER: leave it, and insert another comma after 'him'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - doing this would enclose 'and Ophelia' between two commas. However, to understand which relationship is being talked about it is crucial not to break up 'between him and Ophelia'.
        ANSWER: remove it, but insert a comma after 'relationship'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - it needs to be clear which relationship is being talked about, so there shouldn't be a comma (or any other punctuation) within the phrase 'the relationship between him and Ophelia'.
        ANSWER: remove it
        FEEDBACK: Correct - there's no need for a comma at all in this sentence. At the moment, the comma inserts an unnecessary break between the subject of the sentence ('the relationship...') and the verb ('is').

    QUESTION 0 What would you do with the comma in this sentence?
        ANSWER: leave it where it is
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this comma serves no purpose. The brackets are enclosing this particular phrase, so there's no need for a comma just before the closing bracket.
        ANSWER: move it to after the closing bracket
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the brackets enclose the additional information and there is no need to insert a comma between the subject of the sentence ('The action of...') and the verb ('is given').
        ANSWER: remove it
        FEEDBACK: Correct - this sentence does not need a comma. The brackets contain additional information - if the brackets and the phrase within them are removed, the sentence is grammatically correct without any further punctuation: 'The action of coming to terms with the English environment is given a physical dimension.'

INTRO <font size="4">'Orlando', by Virginia Woolf, is a novel that creates an idea of selfhood that is not gender specific. This is evident in the very first line of the novel, &quot;He - for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it.&quot; Clothes are used to similar effect in Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot;. For example, when his mother accosts him about his seeming over-reaction to the loss of his father and her own marriage to his uncle, Hamlet answers: &quot;Seems, madam? Nay, it is. I know not 'seems'./Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,/Nor customary suits of solemn black/<sup>2</sup> .&quot; Here, clothing is illustrative of the 'turmoil' within Hamlet's soul.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Are the quotation marks in this passage all properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes
        FEEDBACK: No, none of them are.  The names of the works, Orlando and Hamlet, being the names of plays, should be in italics with no quotation marks. The quotation from Orlando should be enclosed in single quotation marks.  The full stop at the end should come after the closing quotation mark because this quotation is enclosed within a sentence. The quotation from Hamlet, being longer than two lines, should be set apart from the main text and indented (but not centred) and, when layed out in that way, requires no quotation marks. 'Turmoil' requires no quotation marks unless you are using it as a direct textual quotation, in which it requires a reference to make this clear.

    QUESTION 0 Should the poems' titles be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Italics are used for individually published works: for example, books, plays, journals and longer poems, but not for the titles of individual, shorter poems.
        ANSWER: No
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Italics are used for book titles, but not for poem titles.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  There are rules about the use of italics. Italics are used for individually published works: for example, books, plays, journals and longer poems, but not for the titles of individual, shorter poems.  It is important to stick to these rules.
    QUESTION 1 Should the poems' titles be enclosed in quotation marks?
        ANSWER: Yes
        FEEDBACK: Correct - to clearly indicate to the reader that these are specific poems, quotation marks should be used.
        ANSWER: No
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - the poem titles need to be clearly indicated as such to the reader.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - there are rules about the use of quotation marks. Click on the blue question mark near the top of this page to find out more.
    QUESTION 2 Are the words in the poems' titles correctly capitalised?
        ANSWER: Yes
        FEEDBACK: No. The Collar and Sonnet No. Fourteen are correctly capitalised, but A Hymn to God the Father should be capitalised in this way, not as in the example.
        ANSWER: No
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The Collar and Sonnet No. Fourteen are correctly capitalised, but A Hymn to God the Father should be capitalised in this way, not as in the example.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not a matter of choice.  There are rules, which are not there to annoy, but to provide consistency and clarity.

<p>The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself' (Fitzgerald 105).</p> 
    QUESTION 0 There's something wrong with the punctuation in this sentence - what is it?
        ANSWER: There are too many commas.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The commas in this sentence are all needed.
        ANSWER: There shouldn't be brackets around the reference details.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The reference details are critical.  Brackets single them out but don't interrupt the main flow of the sentence.
        ANSWER: There's an opening quotation mark missing - it isn't clear where the quotation begins.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Where does the quotation start? The reader doesn't want to have to look up the page in the book to find the quote, so it's crucial that the quote is correctly defined by quotation marks.

    QUESTION 0 The writer has used a semi-colon in this sentence, but hasn't used it correctly. Which punctuation mark should replace it?
        ANSWER: colon
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - this sentence needs to flow more naturally than a colon would allow it to. 
        ANSWER: full stop
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - inserting a full stop would mean that the newly created second sentence would have to be rewritten as it isn't currently a complete sentence. However, the content of this second phrase is critical to the meaning of this sentence, so another punctuation mark would be better suited to this situation.
        ANSWER: comma
        FEEDBACK: Correct - a comma would work best here. As the two phrases are both critical to the meaning of the sentence, they shouldn't be separated but subtley linked. For more information on using commas, click on the blue question mark near the top of the page.

    QUESTION 0 The semi-colon in this sentence has been misused - semi-colons can be used to separate items in a list, but should not introduce a list. What would you change the semi-colon to?
        ANSWER: comma
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - commas never introduce lists, but they can separate items in a list.
        ANSWER: full stop
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - definitely not. A full stop here would result in two incomplete sentences that don't make much sense.
        ANSWER: colon
        FEEDBACK: Correct - a colon can be used here to demonstrate that a list of things is about to follow.
        ANSWER: apostrophe
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect - an apostrophe would be a very random choice here, as apostrophes are used to indicate possession or missing letters. They punctuate words rather than sentences.

        ANSWER: Everything that is italicised at the moment.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.
        ANSWER: 'Chansons de geste' and 'chansons' because they are foreign words.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  These terms are now too familiar to italicise.  Click on the blue question mark above the tasks for more information.

        ANSWER: Yes.  It is a peculiar term, so needs italicising.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This term is not unfamiliar;  nor does it need special emphasis.  No italics either for 'ethos' on its own.

INTRO <font size="4">In both Samuel Becket's Krapp's Last Tape and Virginia Woolf's Orlando, the idea of self is explored through the use of clothing. We meet Krapp reminiscing about his past self. <span style="font-style: italic;">Orlando</span>, too, is defined by what he wears. Before examining the effects of the characters' wardrobe, it is important to define the idea of <span style="font-style: italic;">self</span>. The dictionary states that the self can be &quot;The union of elements that constitute the individual identity of a person&quot;. This self can change, and we can see how the self changes in both &quot;Krapp&quot; and &quot;Orlando&quot; through clothes. As Woolf says: <span style="font-style: italic;"> He - for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it - was in the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters.</span><sup>2</sup><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 In the first sentence, are there any italics missing?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The titles of both books should be in italics.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The titles of both works, being individually published, should be in italics.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: No.  The departmental guidelines on italics, as on many other questions of style, are there to help with clarity and consistency.  In academic essays, both are vital.  Personal choice is not an option.
    QUESTION 1 Should the second mention of Orlando, at the beginning of sentence three, be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  As the title of an individually published work, it should be in italics.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  As the title of an individually published work, it should be in italics.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter whether it's italicised or not.
        FEEDBACK: No.  The departmental guidelines on italics, as on many other questions of style,  are there to help with clarity and consistency.  In academic essays, both are vital.  Personal choice is not an option.Incorrect.  Here, the writer is using Orlando as the name of the main character, rather than the name of the book.
    QUESTION 2 Should the two quotes, the first from the dictionary and the second from Woolf, be italicised?
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter if they are italicised or not.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  It does matter.  Quotes like this should never be italicised, but should appear within single quotation marks.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotes like this should never be italicised, but should appear within single quotation marks.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. Quotes like this should never be italicised, but should appear within single quotation marks.
    QUESTION 3 In the penultimate sentence, are Krapp and Orlando correctly styled?
        ANSWER: Krapp is but Orlando isn't.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Krapp is being referred to as a character, so his name should in in ordinary font.  Orlando is being used as the name of the book, so should be in italics.
        ANSWER: Krapp isn't but Orlando is.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. Krapp is being referred to as a character, so his name should in in ordinary font.  Orlando is being used as the name of the book, so should be in italics.
        ANSWER: Neither are styled correctly.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Krapp is being referred to as a character, so his name should in in ordinary font.  Orlando is being used as the name of the book, so should be in italics.

INTRO <font size="4">Rochester does not ascribe any value to social class, wealth or propriety, and does not let his higher status affect the way he speaks to Jane. He appears to value more an intellect that matches and complements his own. What Jane sees in Rochester is something a little different. She feels sexual love, but also the thrill of empowerment and liberation. The language both characters use reflects this, and since Jane is the narrator, we are drawn to Rochester with her, willing her on.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 What was the title of the essay from which this paragraph was drawn?
        ANSWER: Discuss the relationship between self and religion with reference to two texts from the course.
        FEEDBACK: No, it wasn't this.
        ANSWER: Discuss the relationship between the self and sexual love.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, this is the title, although you wouldn't be absolutely sure, since in this paragraph no explicit link is made by the writer.
        ANSWER: Explore notions of social clas with reference to two texts you have studied. 
        FEEDBACK: No, this wasn't actually the title, although it certainly fits.
        ANSWER: Is Jane Eyre a study in Victorian sexual repression?
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't the title, although from the paragraph, you might be forgiven for thinking it was.
    QUESTION 1 Is there anything lacking from this paragraph?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I think there is.  If you're going to make assertions such as are made about both Jane and Rochester in the example, they must be backed up by quotations, properly styled and referenced.  Without textual evidence, an essay is fatally weakened.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  If you're going to make assertions such as are made about both Jane and Rochester in the example, they must be backed up by quotations, properly styled and referenced.  Without textual evidence, an essay is fatally weakened.

INTRO <font size="4">However, where Gatsby's illusion is crushed by reality, Jane Eyre paradoxically flourishes by virtue of Bronte's fairytale structure. Her persona acts as a mask that protects her against the obstacles of sexual and social oppression. By constructing her sense of self around her own morality and refusing to compromise, she realises her potential.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 What was the title of the essay from which this paragraph is drawn?
        ANSWER: Discuss the relationship between self and social class with reference to two texts you have studied.
        FEEDBACK: No.  The paragraph mentions 'social oppression' but that's not its main thrust.
        ANSWER: Jane Eyre and Jay Gatsby have a great deal in common: discuss.
        FEEDBACK: No.  This doesn't fit.
        ANSWER: Discuss role playing in two novels you have read on this course.
        FEEDBACK: This is correct, and if you read the passage carefully, you'll see that the writer has not forgotten the essay title.
    QUESTION 1 Is there anything lacking in this paragraph?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  If you are going to mention something like Bronte's fairytale structure, you must back this up with evidence.  Quote from the text (properly styled and footnoted or embedded in your essay), and go to the library to find secondary evidence relating to fairytales.  You cannot make assertions from thin air.  Evidence is vital, or a good point is lost.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  If you are going to mention something like Bronte's fairytale structure, you must back this up with evidence.

INTRO <font size="4">As Gatsby envisages Daisy as his America, Nicole represents America in Fitzgerald's <span style="font-style: italic;">Tender is the Night</span>. Dick Diver, as Nicole's doctor, begins to see in her a woman he could look after and love. Their marriage disintegrates because she cannot live up to the ideal Diver has created in his mind. Again, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gatsby</span>, the female is as perishable as anyone else. Diver wants to fulfil his ambition and become a highly respected doctor of psychiatry. However, having to look after Nicole deprives him of this dream. As Nicole and Dick grow together, they grow to become almost one. Unfortunately, their relationship does not fill the gaps in Dick needs to fill in his life, and Nicole merely reinforces that which is already present in his personality. The idea of the fragmentary human being is strengthened by the chronology of the narrative.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 What is the essay title from which this paragraph is drawn?
        ANSWER: 'Fitzgerald's Nicole Diver embodies an America of dreams'.  How true is this?
        FEEDBACK: No, this wasn't the title.  Ask yourself why you thought this might be the title.  Has the writer not linked the paragraph and the title clearly enough together?
        ANSWER: Discuss the nature of women in two novels on this course.
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't the title.  Ask yourself why you thought it might be.  Has the writer not made the point of the paragraph sufficiently clear?
        ANSWER: Discuss the concept of the American Dream in 20th century American literature.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, this is the title, and I think the writer has tried to make the link clear in the first line, but tails away into narrative.
    QUESTION 1 Is there anything missing from this paragraph?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I think so too.  If you are going to make assertions, such as that Nicole doesn't fill the gaps in Diver's life, then you need textual references (either properly footnoted or embedded in the text).  Without references, the whole paragraph is fatally weakened.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I think there is. If you are going to make assertions, such as that Nicole doesn't fill the gaps in Diver's life, then you need textual references (either properly footnoted or embedded in the text).  Without references, the whole paragraph is fatally weakened.
    QUESTION 2 Is the last line of the paragraph a good last line?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I don't think so. The last line of a paragraph should either lead directly to a new paragraph on the same topic, or link very clearly back to the title. 
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The last line of a paragraph should either lead directly to a new paragraph on the same topic, or link very clearly back to the title.  For more information, see the section of this site devoted to concluding lines, or look at the whole essay example.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span> 'If an artist's work is strikingly different from that of his predecessors or contemporaries, one may well look for the source of his originality to those of his interests which fall outside the proper sphere of his own medium.' To what extent is it possible for visual art to influence literature?<br /><br />Gertrude Stein's Three Lives and the poetry of William Carlos Williams are both very different from the work produced by their contemporaries. They are striking for many reasons, most notably for their originality. In their work, these two writers found new forms of prose and poetry. This essay will look at the sources of their inspiration - the visual arts - and the influence that art had on their work.<br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is this first paragraph relevant to the essay title?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It seems highly relevant.  I think if you didn't know the essay title, it would be possible to guess what it was from this paragraph. 
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  If you couldn't see the essay title, it would be possible to guess it.  The writer speaks of different sources of inspiration for writers and how this contributed to their originality.
    QUESTION 1 Is there anything missing from this paragraph?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  We need a concrete reference to the time these writers were writing.  Were they contemporaries?  What century are we in?  Don't assume your reader will fill in these kinds of gaps.  References add weight to an essay and inspire confidence.  You can never have too many.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Write on one of the following: paratext; parody; pastiche; revision; screen adaptation; source; the book; with reference to two works you have studied on this course.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, the adapting of written works for film and television has been around for many years. For as long as there have been people writing scripts there has been some form of adaptation for the big or small screen. There are many different types of adaptation, including comic-book adaptations, video-game adaptations, television adaptations and film adaptations. Usually, these adaptations are made for a target audience. The film version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Wuthering Heights</span> was fairly popular, as was the film version of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Importance of Being Earnest</span>, which also won a couple of minor awards. Screen adaptations are very interesting because they also take liberties with the text.<br /></font><br /><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Is this a good example of an evidence based argument?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: A marker certainly wouldn't agree.  This paragraph states the obvious and does not present an argument.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I quite agree.  There is no argument presented here, and the terms 'fairly popular' and 'a couple of minor awards' do not constitute evidence.
    QUESTION 1 What should come next?
        ANSWER: A new topic.
        FEEDBACK: No.  This topic has not been dealt with properly yet. 
        ANSWER: Examples.
        FEEDBACK: Yes.  An assertion has been made - that screen adaptations are interesting because they take liberties with the text.  Now we need concrete, referenced examples.
    QUESTION 2 Would a tutor mark this paragraph with a tick, a cross or nothing at all?
        ANSWER: Tick.
        FEEDBACK: There is nothing to tick.  This paragraph states the obvious and does not present an argument.
        ANSWER: Cross.
        FEEDBACK: I shouldn't think a marker would bother.  With no argument presented, the paragraph isn't really worth marking. 
        ANSWER: Nothing at all.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. A marker would leave such a paragraph unmarked because the vague generalisations and lack of examples mean that it's just padding.

INTRO  <font size="4">Essay title: Intertextuality and Influence: assess Roland Barthe's view that texts 'blend and clash' with reference to two works you have studied.<br /><br />Texts chosen: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Waste Land</span>, by T. S. Eliot and <span style="font-style: italic;">Wuthering Heights</span> by Emily Bronte.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and then the following short paragraphs. In your view, are the paragraphs relevant or irrelevant? When you've decided, click on the text and see if your opinion agrees with ours. Each paragraph comes with an explanation, so it's worth browsing through them all.</font>
        ANSWER: Wuthering Heights is the only novel that Emily Bronte published.  She was one of the three famous Bronte sisters, the others being Charlotte and Anne.  To avoid the stigma attached to female writers, Emily published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell.
        FEEDBACK: None of this is relevant to the essay title.  The biographical details of authors are seldom relevant in themselves.  If a writer uses such details, he or she has to make them relevant by relating them directly to the essay title.
        ANSWER: The posthumous second edition of Wuthering Heights was revised by Charlotte, so although the book was written by Emily alone, the version we read is not solely Emily's work.  Charlotte could not be described as a co-author, but her influence, though hidden to the general reader, is evident throughout.
        FEEDBACK: This is relevant.  The writer is showing how, even in a work we associate entirely with one author, another author's influence is present.  The use of the word 'influence' links it directly to the essay title.
        ANSWER: Although James Joyce is not referenced by Eliot, his writing style, particularly in Ulysses, is echoed in The Waste Land.  James Joyce published Ulysses in 1922.  The book was divided into eighteen chapters or episodes, and the text attracted controversy right from the start.  There is no unified manuscript of Ulysses, with the result that the text, written in chaotic style, is also editorially chaotic.
        FEEDBACK: The reference to Ulysses is good, but the writer does not keep the reference focused, instead going off on a Joycean tangent.  None of the details about Ulysses are related back to the essay title, leaving the reader puzzled as to their relevance.  Always ask yourself:  what point am I trying to make?  Then make sure you you have actually made the point explicitly.  Your essay marker is not a mind-reader. 
        ANSWER: Even the title of The Waste Land is not original, but alludes to the old Arthurian legend, The Fisher King.  The king has, for whatever reason, become infertile and as a result, his kingdom is as infertile as he is.  To restore the kingdom's fertility, the king must wait for someone to come along and ask the right questions.  For Eliot, the world was similarly sterile.  Many fertile young men had been killed in the First World War, 150,000 on the Somme alone.  England seemed like a 'waste land'.
        FEEDBACK: The allusion to The Fisher King is good, but though the following sentences are not completely irrelevant, they drift.  The sentence 'For Eliot, the world was similarly sterile' starts to link back to the essay title, but then veers away.  The Somme statistic is unnecessary:  this is an essay about intertextuality.  Take care not to let your references control you rather than you controlling them.

        ANSWER: So, the American dream continues to haunt Americans. 'Bring me your huddled masses' is just as potent now as it ever was.  
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too general.  They give no clue as to what the essay was specifically about.
        ANSWER: The American story 'is the history of all aspiration - not just the American dream, but the human dream'.  Human beings are not perfect and every dream is corrupt.  That is what 20th century American literature teaches us.
        FEEDBACK: This quote should be attributed.  The rest of the ending isn't connected quite firmly enough to the essay title. 
        ANSWER: Thus we can see that 20th century American literature explores both the idea of unattainable perfection and the corrupt idea of the American Dream through total immersion.  Contemporary authors could not remain detached.  Of these authors, F. Scott Fitzgerald may be the most famous but, as this essay has shown, he was by no means alone.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  It clinches the essay, referring directly to the title and to the material in the essay.  It finishes everything off neatly.
        ANSWER: 20th century American literature cannot help exploring the idea of an unattainable perfection and the corrupt idea of the American Dream.  I think it makes 20th century American literature interesting and readers can learn a lot from it.
        FEEDBACK: This option starts well but drifts off into the personal 'I think' and the colloquial 'can learn a lot from it'.  An academic essay should finish in an academic way.

        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, Fitzgerald seems more concerned with manipulating the text to stand for ideas and opinions whilst Browning moulds characters and tells their story.  That two authors can use one literary medium to two such different effects very clearly demonstrates the power of an English language novel.
        FEEDBACK: Just reading these lines, you might think the essay question was on the power of the English novel rather than the relationship between the writers' opinions and their work.  A neat finish, but of the wrong essay?
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, Fitzgerald's opinions, at least on the subject of money, are clearly related to his work, whereas the relationship between Browning's opinions and his work is rather more opaque.  As this essay has also shown, this is partly the difference between a novelist and a poet.  However, It is also clear that understanding this relationship is crucial to a full understanding of a text, which is why the study of a writer's life is so satisfying and productive. 
        FEEDBACK: These lines draw in the two chosen writers, contrasting them and then finishing with a closing statement that brings them together.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: There is always something interesting about authors' opinions.  We all like to share what we think.  These days those of us who do not write books or poetry as Fitzgerald and Browning did, have access to Facebook and other social networking sites.  That way, we all know exactly where we stand.
        FEEDBACK: The first line here is fine but the writer has then wandered off.  Mentioning the two poets is good, but should be in the context of the content of the essay, not bringing in something new.  The last sentence has a sense of finality but is the wrong sentence for this essay.<br />

        ANSWER: In the works of both Shakespeare and F. Scott Fitzgerald, we find role-playing and performance in all their many guises.  As this essay has shown, these devices are not just significant.  For plot and character development in both play and novel, performance and role-playing are vital. 
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  These lines refer directly to the essay question and to the two chosen authors. The last line makes a bold closing statement.
        ANSWER: Performance and role-playing in these two texts create more realistically complex and hard-to-decipher personalities.  Identity is irrevocably affected by the behaviour cause by the role-playing and the direct or indirect consequences which that behaviour had on the self.  In the end it is left up to the readers to speculate and use their own judgement to form their impression of each character's true self.
        FEEDBACK: These lines refer to words in the essay title but we then bump into the colloquialism of 'hard-to-decipher'.   The themes of the essay, for example, identity, may well be reprised, but not in the terms of the essay title.  The concluding line drifts off the point. 
        ANSWER: All life is a performance and it is no different in the works of Shakespeare and Fitzgerald.  Playing roles is what people do to get through life.  The characters Hamlet and Gatsby are made human by this.  It is why we are interested in them.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are more pub philosopher than academic essay writer.  It's so tempting to end an essay with a conceptual flourish.  Resist it.  It never works, not even when linked to two literary characters.

        ANSWER: Herbert purposefully names his poem 'The Collar' to provoke notions of repression and restraint.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  The last line of the previous paragraph leads the reader to expect to read next about 'The Collar'.  The writer fulfils that expectation without any messing about.
        ANSWER: In the seventeenth century, poets often used religious imagery in their poems.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence may bear some relation to the essay, but it comes from nowhere.  It does not belong here.
        ANSWER: George Herbert was a poet who went to Trinity College, Cambridge.
        FEEDBACK: This is an entirely narrative line.  It does not further any idea.   The reader already knows that Herbert is a poet.  It jars.
        ANSWER: The opening line 'Batter my heart, three-person'd God' turns Donne's Sonnet XIV into a declaration of war.
        FEEDBACK: Had the final line listed Donne's Sonnet XIV first, i.e. before 'The Collar' and 'A Hymn to God the Father', this would have been a good link line.  As it is, it feels out of sequence.  If you make a list in your final line, unless you have very good reason not to, stick to the order.

        ANSWER: London features largely in Dickens' works because he both loved it and loathed it.
        FEEDBACK: This is not completely wrong, but reads a bit like padding.  You would need to demonstrate very quickly why you felt this information was relevant to your thesis.
        ANSWER: Pip is an orphan, who has seen his sister act with violence towards her gentle husband.

        ANSWER: In London we see the first stirrings of an unbecoming snobbery in Pip.
        FEEDBACK: This relates directly to the final line. We see a repetition of 'London' in the context of Pip being 'shaped'.  It moves the essay on very smoothly.
        ANSWER: Great Expectations is set both in the country and the town.

        ANSWER: Part of the American Dream is to acquire massive wealth and then retire.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence echoes 'wealth' but in an unrelated context.  The reader is brought up short instead of eased along.
        ANSWER: Wealth plays a central role in this novel.

        ANSWER: Possession, not just in its ordinary sense but also in the sense of people possessing each other, fascinated Fitzgerald.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  It echoes both the words and the theme of the final line of the previous paragraph and broadens the topic out.  
        ANSWER: Nicole represents America in Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night.
        FEEDBACK: This jolts, since it bears no relation to the final line.  A new topic is fine, but must be linked to the previous topic.
        ANSWER: The Great Gatsby was the third of Fitzgerald's novels to be published.
        FEEDBACK: This is in danger of being irrelevant.  However, if this is the first time The Great Gatsby is mentioned by name, and the writer goes on to explain the reference to Daisy and possession, then the link would be made.
        ANSWER: The American Dream is challenged in The Great Gatsby.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Choose the opening line or lines most appropriate to the essay title set. Every choice has an explanation, so if you find our preferred option quickly, it is still worth browsing through them all. The same essay title may be used more than once.</span></font><!--EndFragment--> 
        ANSWER: The American Dream has been the inspiration for many writers drawn to the United States to live and work.
        FEEDBACK: This option is too general.  If were deleted, it would not be missed.
        ANSWER: There has never been such a thing as the American Dream.  It is a construct dreamed up by newspapers.
        FEEDBACK: This option does not relate to the question.
        ANSWER: In his essay 'The Evolving American Dream:  The Pursuit of Happiness' in 'Gatsby, Tender is the Night and the Last Tycoon', John F. Callahan states that the author F. Scott Fitzgerald 'embodied in his tissues and nervous system the fluid polarities of the American experience:  success and failure, illusion and disillusion;  dream and nightmare'.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  It is directly relevant to the essay title, addressing both sides of the question:  20th century American literature and the American Dream.
        ANSWER: According to Wikipedia, the American Dream is a 'national ethos of the United States of America in which democratic ideals are perceived as a promise of prosperity for its people. In the American Dream, first expressed by James Truslow Adams in 1931, citizens of every rank feel that they can achieve a "better, richer, and happier life'.
        FEEDBACK: Wikipedia is never a good place to start.  What's more, if you are going to define the American Dream, it's important to define it in relation to the essay question and not just give a blank definition.

        ANSWER: The relationship between the self and religion is one of reliance and balance.  A religious experience could alter the self, while the self could alter perceptions of religion.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are the best option.  They get straight to the point.  It is clear what the essay title is and that the writer has thought about a snappy and arresting opening.
        ANSWER: A relationship between the self and religion has existed since the introduction of Christianity.   In Britain 72% of the population is Christian but only 10% attend church.
        FEEDBACK: These lines echo the words of the title, but go off at a tangent.  These statistics are entirely irrelevant.
        ANSWER: 'Religion is the opiate of the people,' said Karl Marx, which, for some, also defines the relationship between religion and self.
        FEEDBACK: This line echoes the language of the title but uses an irrelevant quotation.
        ANSWER: I am no longer religious because, like Jane Eyre, I found the relationship between religion and self confusing.

        FEEDBACK: This isn't bad, although some marker might think it just states the obvious.
        ANSWER: We are all born somewhere, and where that somewhere is clearly affects the person we turn out to be.
        FEEDBACK: This is a broad and highly questionable generalisation.  My husband was born in Kuala Lumpur, which bears no relation to the person he is now.  In any case, such a generalisation has no place in an academic essay.
        ANSWER: In both Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, the relationship between the external environment an the self is a crucial authorial device. 
        FEEDBACK: This sentence both names the chosen authors and opens up a discussion.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: I think that the environment into which authors pitch their characters is one of the things a reader notices first.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion is questionable, and the 'I think' makes this opening far too conversational.

        ANSWER: Family life has always been important to authors.  It is where many get their inspiration from. 
        FEEDBACK: two mass generalisations, with no supporting evidence and only the vaguest connection to the question.  It is clumsy to finish a sentence with the preposition 'from' (see danglers elsewhere on this site).  
        ANSWER: There are few authors for whom the importance of family is more crucial in the defining or shaping of the self than Charles Dickens and Seamus Heaney.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option. It starts with a confident bang.  The writer gets straight into the question.

        ANSWER: In discussing the relationship between the self and religion, I shall use Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Shakespeare's Hamlet, within these two texts I shall evaluate the impact of religion on the self, and the development of the self that occurs through a relationship with religion.
        FEEDBACK: Apart from identifying the texts, this over-long sentence adds little to the opening of this essay.  It simply restates the question in different ways.
        ANSWER: There can be no doubt that in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and in Shakespeare's Hamlet, the relationship between the self and religion plays a prominent role.   Bronte suggests that Mr. Rochester is becoming, or becomes, almost holy.  She questions God indirectly and more directly throughout the novel.  Jane is surrounded by individuals of different beliefs.
        FEEDBACK: This starts well.  The first sentence is bold and arresting. It then wanders off into Jane Eyre, making no distinction between real author and fictional heroine, leaving the reader puzzled. 
        ANSWER: The relationship between self and religion is fundamental to two classic but very different texts, Charlotte Bronte's nineteenth century novel, Jane Eyre, and Shakespeare's sixteenth century play, Hamlet.  This essay will use both texts to demonstrate how religion, and crucially, its loss, alters the sense these very different characters have of themselves, thus linking Jane and Hamlet in unexpected ways.  The case must not be overstated.  However, this essay ... 
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  The opening sentence is short but full of information, and is followed by an exposition of the essay's thesis.  In an interesting twist, the author demonstrates an awareness that her thesis may be overblown, but also a confidence that she can carry the reader along.   Awareness and confidence are attractive in opening lines. 
        ANSWER: A relationship between the self and religion has existed for as long as historical record has been able to evidence it.  Over the centuries, since the introduction of Christianity, its role within countries, communities and the lives of individuals has been constantly changing.  In 2008, 33% of the world claimed to be Christian.
        FEEDBACK: This might be a decent essay opening, but not for this essay.  Every single piece of information is irrelevant.

Every choice has an explanation, so if you find our preferred option quickly, it is still worth browsing through them all.

        ANSWER: Death comes to us all.  That is a fact of life.  Every day we live is a day nearer to death.   Anticipation of death is, as far as we know, restricted to mankind, which is perhaps why we draw, paint, write or make music.
        FEEDBACK: Too much flannel here.  Ask yourself, with reference to the essay title, 'if these sentences were deleted, would they be missed?'  The answer is no.  General, all-embracing and clichéd comments have no place in an academic essay.
        ANSWER: Hamlet by William Shakespeare and assorted poems by the poet Robert Browning deal very closely with the idea of the anticipation of death.
        FEEDBACK: This gets halfway to the point but 'assorted poems' is incorrect in this context.  You need to offer named examples.  There is no mention of 'self'.
        ANSWER: Anticipation of death is central to the definition of the self in the poems of both George Herbert and John Donne.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  It gets directly to the heart of the question and introduces the chosen authors neatly.
        ANSWER: In the poem 'Life', George Herbert asserts that he is not concerned when death will strike as long as his life is considered 'good' in the eyes of God.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence might be appropriate further into the essay.  The opening sentence needs to introduce the two writers you have chosen and link them directly to the essay question.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: trebuchet ms,verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Choose the opening line or lines most appropriate to the essay title set. Every choice has an explanation, so if you find our preferred option quickly, it is still worth browsing through them all. The same essay title may be used more than once.</span></font><!--EndFragment--> 
        ANSWER: Performance, or role-playing, is a prolific function in both the drama of Hamlet and the poetry of John Donne.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line, though it does mention the two texts chosen, doesn't make much sense.  Prolific function?  Make sure your opening line is clear and unambiguous.
        ANSWER: The function of role-playing is of vital significance in literature.  
        FEEDBACK: This may be true, but should perhaps be shown through the essay and used in the conclusion rather than just stated at the outset.
        ANSWER: The Oxford English Dictionary defines role-playing as "the changing of one's behaviour to fulfil a social role".  In literature, though, I think it's often the rejection of a role that makes us warm to the characters.
        FEEDBACK: Try not to start with a dictionary definition.  'I think it's' is too colloquial.  A general mention of 'literature' is often a waste.  Better to reveal the texts you are going to use.  
        ANSWER: Role playing and performance are not quite the same thing.  Tough both are of central significance in the two texts chosen for this essay, Shakespeare's Hamlet and Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the differences soon become apparent.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option. The opening sentence is short, bold and addresses the essay title directly.  The writer offers a potentially interesting thesis.  The chosen texts are quickly identified and the lines carry a forward momentum.

        ANSWER: George Herbert and John Donne are two poets most commonly associated with the metaphysical style of poetry.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is clear and crisp but bears no relation to the essay title.  It's very important that your essay relates to the title right from the start.
        ANSWER: William Shakespeare's Hamlet and assorted poems by Robert Browning deal closely with the idea of the anticipation of death.
        FEEDBACK: This opening is weakened by the phrase 'assorted poems', which has no place in an academic essay.  Name the poems.
        ANSWER: Anticipation of death is the driving force behind both Shakespeare's Hamlet and Robert Browning's 'The Bishop Orders his Tomb at St. Praxted's Church'.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option. Clear, with the beginnings of an argument - the writer will have to prove this assertion - this line launches us neatly into the essay.
        ANSWER: 'To die, to sleep' says Hamlet.  I think this shows an anticipation of death, which shaped Hamlet's self.
        FEEDBACK: Fine to use a quotation (make sure it is properly referenced in a footnote), but the rather simplistic use made of the quotation here, plus the use of the personal 'I' makes this an unconvincing start.

    QUESTION 0 Which is the correct way to format a book title: enclosed in quotation marks or in italics?
        ANSWER: Enclosed in quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Book and journal titles are italicised, and essay or article titles are enclosed within quotation marks. 
        ANSWER: In italics.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Book and journal titles are italicised, and essay or article titles are enclosed within quotation marks.
    QUESTION 1 Should the quotation marks that are properly used in this example be single or double?
        ANSWER: Double.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Double quotation marks are reserved for quotations within quotations.  Quotation marks should normally be single.
        ANSWER: Single.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Double quotation marks are used for quotations within quotations only.
    QUESTION 2 Is the footnote number in this example properly placed?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The footnote number comes after the final punctuation, i.e. in this case after the full stop.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The footnote number comes after the final punctuation, i.e. in this case after the full stop.
    QUESTION 3 Are the closing quotation marks of the Callahan quote properly placed?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, they're not.  When a quote is part of a bigger sentence, as in this case, the closing quotation marks (which should be single quotation marks) come before the full stop.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  When a quote is part of a bigger sentence, as in this case, the closing quotation marks (which should be single quotation marks) come before the full stop.

    QUESTION 0 In the book title The Reader Over Your Shoulder, are the capital letters correct?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, they're not:  'over' and 'your' should not be capitalised.  Go to the 'formatting - capitals' section of this site for more information.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct:  'over' and 'your' should not be capitalised.  Go to the 'formatting - capitals' section of this site for more information.
    QUESTION 1 Should the book title The Reader over your Shoulder be underlined?  If not, how should it be formatted?
        ANSWER: No, it should not be underlined.  The title should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Book titles, journal titles, long poem titles and the titles of individually published works should be italicised.
        ANSWER: Yes, underlining is fine.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Book titles, journal titles, long poem titles and the titles of individually published works should be italicised.
    QUESTION 2 Should this quotation be italicised, enclosed within quotation marks and indented?
        ANSWER: It should be in plain font but indented and within quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Long quotations are indented (though an indented quotation needs to be over 3 lines long).  Indented quotations ARE NOT also enclosed in quotation marks.
        ANSWER: It should be italicised and indented, but does not need quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: It's true that long quotations are indented (though an indented quotation needs to be over 3 lines long).  However, indented quotations ARE NOT italicised or enclosed in quotation marks.
        ANSWER: This quotation should not be indented or italicised, but should be part of the text and enclosed in quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. It's true that long quotations are indented, but an indented quotation needs to be over 3 lines long and this one is not, so should be run into the text and enclosed in quotation marks.  Indented quotations ARE NOT enclosed in quotation marks.
    QUESTION 3 Are the quotation marks correctly used here?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  They are the wrong way round.  Single quotation marks are used for quotations, and double used for quotations within quotations.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  They are the wrong way round.  Single quotation marks are used for quotations, and double used for quotations within quotations.
    QUESTION 4 Should the brackets round (language) be round, as here, or square?
        ANSWER: Round.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If you insert something into a quotation, you use square brackets.  Square brackets show that it's your insertion, and not part of the quotation.
        ANSWER: Square.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  If you insert something into a quotation, you use square brackets.  Square brackets show that it's your insertion, and not part of the quotation.
    QUESTION 5 Which footnote number, 2 or 3, is correctly placed?
        ANSWER: 2
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The footnote number comes after the final punctuation, in this case the full stop.
        ANSWER: 3
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The footnote number is placed after the final punctuation;  in this case a full stop.
    QUESTION 6 Should closing quotation marks before footnote 2 come before or after the final full stop?
        ANSWER: Before.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.   If the quotation is part of a bigger sentence, the closing quotation mark comes before the full stop, as the quotation is part of the sentence.  The closing quotation mark comes after the full stop if the quotation is a whole sentence in itself. 
        ANSWER: After.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If the quotation is part of a bigger sentence, the closing quotation mark comes before the full stop, as the quotation is part of the sentence.  The closing quotation mark comes after the full stop if the quotation is a whole sentence in itself.

    QUESTION 0 What is wrong with this bibliographical entry?
        ANSWER: There's too much information.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  You should give all the information you can.
        ANSWER: Some information is missing.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  I'm not sure what more information could be given.
        ANSWER: Nothing.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  All the information we need is here.
    QUESTION 1 To what does the pp.2212-2295 refer?
        ANSWER: It refers to a quotation in the text.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  We'd need one page reference for that (no quote could be 83 pages long), and this would appear in a footnote.
        ANSWER: It refers to the number of pages of Alexander Pope in the Norton Anthology.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  With an anthologised poet, it is correct to put in the number of pages he or she takes up in the bigger book.

INTRO <font size="4">Can you match these salutations with the appropriate sign off?</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Dear Mrs. Grant,
        ANSWER: Yours faithfully,
        FEEDBACK: No - Yours faithfully is only used when the salutation is Dear Sir or Dear Madam (i.e. not named).
        ANSWER: Yours ever,
        FEEDBACK: This is a first letter, so this is too informal.
        ANSWER: Very best,
        FEEDBACK: This is more appropriate for an email.
        ANSWER: Yours sincerely,
        FEEDBACK: Yes. This is the most appropriate for a letter beginning 'Dear Mrs. Grant,'.
    QUESTION 1 Dear Sir,
        ANSWER: Yours faithfully,
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  We use 'Yours faithfully' with 'Dear Sir' or 'Dear Madam' (i.e. to an unnamed correspondent).
        ANSWER: Yours sincerely,
        FEEDBACK: No - we use 'Yours sincerely,' with a named person, e.g. 'Dear Mr. Carnforth,'.  Try again.
        ANSWER: With best regards,
        FEEDBACK: No - 'With best regards' is too informal to write when the correspondent is not even named.  Try again.

    QUESTION 0 Yours sincerely,
        ANSWER: Dear Anne Jones,
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  We use 'Yours sincerely' to a formally named person.
        ANSWER: Dear Madam,
        FEEDBACK: No - we use 'Yours faithfully,' if the correspondent is not named.
        ANSWER: Dear John,
        FEEDBACK: You might use 'Yours sincerely' if you didn't know him very well.  But if you are on first name terms, have had a protracted exchange of letters, and particularly if you've met, then you might move to 'Yours ever,'.  This would be very rare with a potential employer.
    QUESTION 1 Yours faithfully,
        ANSWER: Dear Sir,
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  We use 'Yours faithfully,' when the correspondent is not named.
        ANSWER: Dear Lord Sugar,
        FEEDBACK: No - we only use 'Yours faithfully,' when the correspondent is not named.  Try again.

    QUESTION 0 Dear Mrs. McGrath,
        ANSWER: Hello.  I'm really interested in your company and especially the job advert posted on the university website.  
        FEEDBACK: Not a good choice!  There could hardly be a more unprofessional beginning to a letter.  'Hello' is too chatty.  The letter has a gushing start.  If you're replying to a job advertisment (always spell out advertisement in full) then say so at once.
        ANSWER: I would like to apply for the job advertised on the university website.
        FEEDBACK: This is calm, quiet and clear.  The best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: I think I'm highly qualified  and suitable for the job advertised on the university website.
        FEEDBACK: This sounds arrogant and unprofessional.  Your CV will show your qualifications and the employer will judge your suitability.  Not a good choice.

INTRO <font size="4">Which of these covering letter opening sentences is likely to be most attractive to an employer?</font>
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: I am writing about the fantastic job opportunity advertised in the Times.  It has been my life's ambition to work in your company.  If you employ me, you will not regret it.
        FEEDBACK: This is a very overblown response, even if the opportunity really was marvellous.  A potential employer might think you were being ironic.  You need to temper your enthusiasm with professionalism.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: I am writing to apply for the post of junior marketing manager, as advertised in the Times.  I fully appreciate that opportunities to work in companies of such standing do not arise often, and hope that you will find my attached CV of interest. 
        FEEDBACK: This response is keen, but also polite.  I think an employer would appreciate the determined but respectful tone.
        ANSWER: Attaching my CV in response to your advert in the Times.  Hope to hear from you soon.
        FEEDBACK: This is very peremptory and careless.  It would probably hit the bin without the CV being read at all.

        ANSWER: Dear Karen,  Yours sincerely,
        FEEDBACK: Correct.
        ANSWER: Dear Lady Bain, Yours faithfully,
        FEEDBACK: Incorrectly.  We only use 'Yours faithfully' to an unnamed correspondent (usually after Dear Sir or Dear Madam).
        ANSWER: Dear Mr. McNeil, With best regards,
        FEEDBACK: In the context of a job application, this would be incorrect.  Use the formal 'Yours sincerely,'.
        ANSWER: Dear Kirsty Hamilton, Yours faithfully,
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  We only use 'Yours faithfully,' when the correspondent is unnamed.  We need 'Yours sincerely,' here.

INTRO Employers often ask 'what is your greatest weakness and can you demonstrate how you overcome it'. What would be a good opening sentence for your answer? 
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: I don't have any weaknesses.
        FEEDBACK: Not even tempting!
        ANSWER: I have many weaknesses but work hard at them all.
        FEEDBACK: Aaah!  No!
        ANSWER: I recognise that I'm very bad at time-keeping.
        FEEDBACK: I wouldn't go for this one.  To many employers, time-keeping is key.  Make sure it's not a weakness.
        ANSWER: I used to find asking for clarification if I didn't understand an instruction first time intimidating, but I've developed a phrase to use to get me over that hump.
        FEEDBACK: This option is the best on offer here, and not a bad one either.  It shows that once you've recognised a weakness, you set about adopting a strategy to overcome it.  The weakness itself is well chosen.  Many employers will have experienced it themselves.  A shared weakness is often a bond, not a barrier.

INTRO  <font size="4">From the options given, choose the best answer to the competency-based question 'Can you demonstrate how you cope with major change?'. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Change is always a challenge.  A major change for me was moving to university far from my home town.  I joined clubs (swimming, debating, history), volunteered and sat in the common room rather than my bedroom.  I learned that getting over the challenges of change are as much down to your own efforts as the efforts of other people.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good reply.  It describes a real situation and what was learned from it.
    QUESTION 1 
        ANSWER: I've experienced a lot of change.  We've moved house many times because of my dad's work.  I've been to five different schools, but my results never suffered.
        FEEDBACK: This is a poor option.  A situation is described, but not the kind of learning process an employer wants to see.
    QUESTION 2 
        ANSWER: Change is a challenge.  I understand that you need to be very open to it and decide to embrace it in order to be successful in today's world.
        FEEDBACK: This is a bland statement of the obvious.  It would not impress an employer.  Not a good option.
        Task multiplechoice difficulty 2
INTRO <font size="4">From the options offered, which is the best response to the question 'What value does your university degree bring to an employer?' <br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: University is where you discover yourself and learn to stand on your own two feet.
        FEEDBACK: Not an attractive option for an employer.  You don't need to go to university to achieve either of these cliched attributes.
        ANSWER: My university degree was in history, and over my four years I learned to think clearly, communicate effectively and to understand the value of feedback and reflection.  In first year, I also did a course in astronomy so learned to adapt to different academic requirements.  University also taught me how to set and achieve high goals. 
        FEEDBACK: This answer rings at least six key bells for employers.  This is the best option here.
        ANSWER: During my time at university I studied physics and was also was a member of the rugby club and debated for the university.  I also volunteered in the student counselling service and learned to drive the university mini-bus.
        FEEDBACK: Just listing what you did is pointless if you don't also point out the value.  Studying physics at university makes you meticulous, inquiring, investigative.  Rbgy involves team-building.  Counselling develops listening skills.  Driving the university mini-bus is evidence of responsibility and trustworthiness.  An employer won't work these things out for him/herself.  It's up to you to articulate the skills you've learned and the value of those skills.

        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  In ordinary prose, we would certainly use an article, but the tone of a CV is clipped - more like a series of bullet points - so we dispense with the article.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. In ordinary prose, we would certainly use an article, but the tone of a CV is clipped - more like a series of bullet points - so we dispense with the article.

    QUESTION 0 Should there be an article (a, an, the) before 'enthusiastic'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The tone in your covering letter is more expansive than in your CV, and should comprise complete sentences, i.e. include articles where appropriate.  Here, an article is appropriate as the writer is talking about something specific, not a concept.  The concept would be 'enthusiastic honours history students'; the more specific is 'an enthusiastic honours history student'.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The tone in your covering letter is more expansive than in your CV, and should comprise complete sentences, i.e. include articles where appropriate.

    QUESTION 1 Do we need the 'the' in front of 'record keeping'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Although, in a covering letter, the sentences must be complete, 'record keeping' here is used as a concept, not as something specific, for example 'the record keeping of Glasgow University'.  When referring to concepts, the article is usually unnecessary.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.   Although, in a covering letter, the sentences must be complete, 'record keeping' here is used as a concept, not as something specific, for example 'the record keeping of Glasgow University'.  When referring to concepts, the article is usually unnecessary.

    QUESTION 2 Do we need 'the' in front of 'value'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The writer is referring to a specific value:  the value of archives.  She is not referring to values in general.  We need 'the'.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The writer is referring to a specific value:  the value of archives.  She is not referring to values in general.  We need 'the'.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: It always matters.  The writer is referring to a specific value:  the value of archives.  She is not referring to values in general.  We need 'the'.
    QUESTION 3 There is an article (the) missing in this text.  Where should it go?
        ANSWER: In front of 'archives'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The writer is using 'archives' in a general sense, i.e. the value of all archives, so we don't need 'the'.
        ANSWER: In front of 'both'.
        FEEDBACK: No, not there.  Try again.
        ANSWER: In front of 'work'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The writer is talking about quite specific work 'the work that goes into the archives', not just 'work' in general, so we need 'the'.

    QUESTION 0 How many of the word  'the' are missing in this text? 
        ANSWER: One.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Two.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.
        ANSWER: Three.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 Where should they go?
        ANSWER: In front of 'invitations' and 'drink'.
        FEEDBACK: It wouldn't be wrong to put 'the' in front of both those nouns, but it's not strictly necessary.  We can use 'invitations' and 'drink' as a concept or something specific in this instance.  There are two other words which definitely need 'the'.
        ANSWER: In front of 'Sixth Year' and 'license'.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, that's right.  We need 'the' because these are two very specific things: the Sixth Year Year book; and the license for this particular event.

<p><font size="4">I am an experienced administrator, having had the summer work in office of School of Psychology at University of Glasgow.  I also organised Study Day event, linking up for project with the students at Strathclyde University.</font></p>
    QUESTION 0 Is 'the' properly used for the names of the universities, i.e. 'at University of Glasgow'; and 'at the Strathclyde University'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  We need 'at the University of Glasgow', since this phrase describes a particular university.  Q - the university of where? A - the University of Glasgow.  We do not need 'the' in front of Strathclyde University, as this is a plain name, like Jane Smith or Yan Hui.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: It always matters.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 Is it right, in this context, to use 'the' in front of 'summer work' and in front of 'students'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.<br />
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'Summer work' is actually a concept, rather than a specific.  A specific reference would be 'the summer clearout' or 'the summer recruitment drive'.  We don't need 'the' in front of 'students' because you're not referring to all the students at Strathclyde University: you're referring to some of the students, so it's more accurate just to say 'students'.  <br />
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: It always matters.  Try again.
    QUESTION 2 Apart from the 'the' in front of 'University of Glasgow' there are three other missing instances of 'the'.  Where should they go?
        ANSWER: In front of 'office; in front of 'School of Psychology'; and in front of 'project'.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  These are all specific references.  Q:  which office?  A: the office of the School of PsychologyQ: which school? A:  the School of Psychology.  We need 'the' in front of project because it is a particular project, i.e. a Study Day event.
    QUESTION 3 Should there be an article in front of 'Study Day event', and if so, what should it be?
        ANSWER: No article needed.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.<br />
        ANSWER: We need 'the'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We do need an article, but not 'the'.  We'd need 'the' if the Study Day event was given a specific time and day, i.e. 'the Study Day event on 14th December'. <br />
        ANSWER: We need 'a'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  We are referring in general terms to a Study Day event, of which the particulars are not yet known. <br />

        ANSWER: Yes.

        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  In this context, 'psychological' is an adjective.  Q: what kind of theories?  A: psychological.  Adjectives don't need capitals unless in titles, e.g. A. Curran's book, Psychological Insights.

        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  'Alzheimer' should be capitalised as it's a proper name, but disease is a common noun and doesn't need capitalising.
        ANSWER: I can choose.
        FEEDBACK: I wouldn't say so.  The disease is called 'Alzheimer's', so the word 'disease' is a common noun and common nouns are not capitalised.

    QUESTION 0 Which of the commas should be changed to a colon or a semi-colon?
        ANSWER: The first comma.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The first comma doesn't provide the right kind of pause.  For maximum impact, we need a colon or a semi-colon so that the second part of the sentence stands out.
        ANSWER: The second comma.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. This part of the sentence should flow, so the comma should be removed, not replaced.
    QUESTION 1 Once you've decided which comma needs to be changed, should it be changed to a colon or a semi-colon?
        ANSWER: A colon.
        FEEDBACK: Actually, either would do.  A colon signals an explanation or examples to come; a semi-colon links two complete sentences that are closely related.  Both these conditions apply here, so you can take your pick.

        ANSWER: A profile needs to be one paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A profile should be one paragraph, since it sits at the top of a CV and its function is to contrast with the very clipped information that will appear in the rest of the CV.  It therefore needs to be carefully constructed so that information isn't lost.  Here, I think the list of skills should be elsewhere.  The profile could then include additional relevant information.

        FEEDBACK: It is your CV, but there's little point in writing one in a style employers dislike.  A CV should use a clipped, informative tone, and leave out personal pronouns (see information behind blue question mark for examples).

INTRO <font size="4">From the start of a personal statement:<br /><br />I really want to do something important with my life, which is why I've decided to apply to the University of Glasgow to do a PhD on the changing nature of Coleridge's religious beliefs. I think, in our modern times, Coleridge speaks to us today and has a lot to tell us about ourselves, the universe and God. I've read everything there is to read on Coleridge, and have followed his tracks through the Quantocks and the Lake District, and even through the Hartz mountains in Germany.<br /><br />You may wonder why a PhD on Coleridge's religious beliefs is important. There are two reasons: first, I don't think anybody has examined this aspect of Coleridge's life in the kind of attention to detail I intend to bring; and secondly, not being a native English speaker, I notice things in his writings that native English speakers may not necessarily see. <br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the tone of this personal statement likely to be attractive to a potential PhD supervisor?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's enthusiastic and clear.
        FEEDBACK: It is certainly enthusiastic and clear, but the tone is childish.  It is childish, for example, to write 'I really want to do something important with my life'.  That is taken as read with a PhD application.  
        ANSWER: No.  It's enthusiastic, but there's something not quite right about it.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It is certainly enthusiastic and clear, but the tone is childish.  It is childish, for example, to write 'I really want to do something important with my life'.  That is taken as read with a PhD application.
    QUESTION 1 Are the reasons for wanting to do a PhD on Coleridge's changing religious beliefs set out persuasively?
        ANSWER: Yes.  The reasons are good, and set out clearly.
        FEEDBACK: The reasons may be good but they are not set out well.  If you're applying to do a PhD, you need to know whether your potential ground has been covered before.  In other words, writing 'I think' immediately injects an element of doubt.  A personal statement should 'know', not 'think'.  I also find the tone of the second reason - that native English speakers may miss things - a little patronising.  All in all, the tone of this personal statement is likely to irritate rather than engage a potential supervisor.
        ANSWER: No.  The reasons are neither good nor persuasive.
        FEEDBACK: I agree in part.  It's arguable as to whether the reasons are good, but in any event, they are not set out well.  If you're applying to do a PhD, you need to know whether your potential ground has been covered before.  In other words, writing 'I think' immediately injects an element of doubt.  A personal statement should 'know', not 'think'.  I also find the tone of the second reason - that native English speakers may miss things - a little patronising.

        ANSWER: No.  You need to mention your duties, however unappealing they might be.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  You should list your duties, but you could adopt a different tone.  For example, 'line-managed staff; responsible for safety and security'.

    QUESTION 0 Three words in this text are wrongly capitalised.  What are they?
        ANSWER: Word, photoshop and dreamweaver
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These are all proper names, i.e. the names of products, so should be capitalised.
        ANSWER: Developed, Professional and Project
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  These are just an ordinary verb (developed), an ordinary adjective (professional) and an ordinary noun (project), so none of them needs a capital.

    QUESTION 0 How many errors should a good proofreader have noticed in this text?
        ANSWER: 2
        FEEDBACK: Try again.<br />
        ANSWER: 5
        FEEDBACK: Try again.<br />
        ANSWER: 8
        FEEDBACK: Well done.<br />
        ANSWER: 6
        FEEDBACK: Try again.<br />
        ANSWER: 7
        FEEDBACK: Try again.
    QUESTION 1 There are two singular nouns that should be plural.  Can you find them?
        ANSWER: ability, insight
        FEEDBACK: No - try again.<br />
        ANSWER: job, receptionist
        FEEDBACK: Try again.<br />
        ANSWER: job, customer
        FEEDBACK: Well done. <br />
        ANSWER: customer, pressure
        FEEDBACK: Try again.
    QUESTION 2 There's a subject/verb mismatch.  Which one is it?
        ANSWER: experiences/gives
        FEEDBACK: Well done.<br />
        ANSWER: award/gave
        FEEDBACK: No - this is fine.  Try again.
    QUESTION 3 What's needs correcting in the Mark Scott Leadership for life award?
        ANSWER: It should be followed by an acronym, i.e. MSLFLA.
        FEEDBACK: No - this would only apply if you were writing a report which mentioned this award many times and you wanted to shorten the title for ease of reading.
        ANSWER: The 'L' of 'leadership' should be in lower case.
        FEEDBACK: No - try again.
        ANSWER: 'Life' and 'Award' should be capitalised.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  All the major words of the award should be capitalised:  the Mark Scott Leadership for Life Award.
    QUESTION 4 We're missing two articles (a, an, the).  Where should they go?  You'll need to choose more than one option, since there are two missing articles.
        ANSWER: We need 'the' in front of 'customer'.
        FEEDBACK: If the reference was to one customer only, then 'the customer' would be correct.  But the text is refering to customers in general, so should be plural, and because it is a general reference, no article is needed.<br />
        ANSWER: We need 'a' in front of 'valuable'.
        FEEDBACK: That's right, if you're using 'valuable lesson' in the singular.  Then we'd need 'a valuable lesson'.  If using the plural, i.e. 'valuable lessons', then no article is required because this is a general expression.<br />
        ANSWER: We need 'the' in front of 'pressure'.
        FEEDBACK: No - no article required in front of 'pressure', since pressure is a concept and concepts seldom need articles.<br />
        ANSWER: We need 'the' in front of 'public'.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'The public' is a particular, identifiable entity, so needs an article.<br />
    QUESTION 5 There's a word wrongly used in this text.  What is it?
        ANSWER: 'interact'
        FEEDBACK: No - nothing wrong with 'interact'.<br />
        ANSWER: 'dealt with'
        FEEDBACK: No - that phrase is correct.<br />
        ANSWER: 'complete'
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'Complete' is an adjective, e.g. 'the complete course'.  Here, we need a noun - completion - so the text should read:   '... whilst my completion of the Mark Scott etc.'

    QUESTION 0 What type of CV would be appropriate to offer for this job?
        ANSWER: Chronological.
        FEEDBACK: This would be appropriate here since one of the 'essentials' (E1) is 'learning gained through relevant work experience or training' and experience of basic compuuting. Banked up experience, together with skills developed during your experiences, would be very appealing.<br />
        ANSWER: Skills-based.
        FEEDBACK: I'd say this wasn't so appropriate here.  The job's 'essential skills' are general, e.g. 'good proof reading'.  Read the advertisement carefully.  What you've learned from experience seems very important to the employer, together with excellent writing and observational skills.  These attributes might be better shown through a chronological CV.  And obviously, if your CV isn't grammatically perfect, you'll get no further.  <br />
    QUESTION 1 Do you need to show knowledge of William Cullen or the Royal College of Physicians?
        ANSWER: Yes.  You always need to show some knowledge of a project's topic.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree that you always need to show some knowledge of a project's topic, but knowlege certainly demonstrates motivation, an attribute employers value very highly. <br />
        ANSWER: No.  You don't need to show any knowledge of the actual topic.

        ANSWER: Chronological.
        FEEDBACK: I wouldn't say so.
        ANSWER: Skills-based.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. The list of key skills is very clear.  It is also highlighted.  You need to construct your CV to show these skills first, particularly if you're a little short on the 2-3 years' experience they're looking for.  If you can prove your skills, you might get to interview even without the experience.
    QUESTION 1 For this job, should you send your CV by email or on paper?
        ANSWER: Paper.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Read the advertisement carefully.  It says 'send your CV in a word doc'.  Not reading the advertisement properly is not a good start.
        ANSWER: Email.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The advertisement says quite clearly 'send your CV in a word doc'. If you can't follow simple instructions, you'll be lucky to get an interview.
        ANSWER: Doesn't matter.

    QUESTION 0 What type of CV would be best to offer here?
        ANSWER: Chronological.
        FEEDBACK: Chronological would be fine here.<br />
        ANSWER: Skills-based.
        FEEDBACK: This wouldn't be so appropriate here, since it's clear that training will be given, and the essential skills required is a 'passion for the financial markets and sales'. This would be illustrated by the extra-curricular activities you took on whilst a student:  for example, membership of the Glasgow University Trading and Investment Club.  This could be demonstrated in a chronological or a general skills-based CV.<br />
    QUESTION 1 What is the main attribute that should come across in your CV?
        ANSWER: Imagination.

        ANSWER: Enthusiasm.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The first on the 'essentials' list is 'a passion for the financial markets' etc.  You would demonstrate this through your extra-curricular activities.<br />
        ANSWER: Good teamworking skills.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The language of the advertisement shouts 'competitive spirit' (e.g. good at cold-calling, driven to succeed, preparing sales pitches) rather than teamworking.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these starts to the short paragraph would be likely to make the best impression?
        ANSWER: I am passionate about books.  Since graduating in 2007, I've been writing one of my own. 
        FEEDBACK: At the risk of rejecting the next J. K. Rowling, I wouldn't be impressed by this.<br />
        ANSWER: I've just graduated with a First Class degree in English Literature and have spent the past three Christmas vacations working in Waterstone's.
        FEEDBACK: This information would be in the body of your CV.  The 50 word paragraph is an opportunity for you to showcase your character.<br />

        FEEDBACK: I like this one. It shows some originality and well-directed enthusiasm.  The applicant doesn't just rely on the hackneyed  'I love books':  there's an understanding of the difficulties faced by the potential employer.  Understanding is always attractive.  I'd go for this one.
    QUESTION 1 Do you need an English Literature degree for this job?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A 'keen interest in modern fiction' is not limited to Eng Lit graduates.

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Almost nobody works entirely alone, so evidence of 'soft skills' is vital, even for computing scientists.

INTRO <font size="4">You have a first class degree in computing science.  What other skills do you need to secure a job?</font>
    QUESTION 0 You have a first class degree in computing science.  What other skills do you need to secure a job?
        ANSWER: No other skills:  good coding skills are enough.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Millions of computing science students have good coding skills.  You must show you have other skills as well.
        ANSWER: You need good interpersonal skills.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  No matter how brilliant you are, employers need to feel you'll fit in.  Interpersonal skills, i.e. showing you can get on with other people, are vital. 
        ANSWER: You need detailed knowledge of every type of programming.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Employers don't expect you to know everything.  They do, however, expect you to have learned how to learn quickly and effectively.
        ANSWER: You need to be able to smile.
        FEEDBACK: Yes! You need to show that you want the job and are going to add to the general office cheeriness, not detract from it.
    QUESTION 1 Employability is all about your degree grade.
        ANSWER: True.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Your degree grade is important, but it's equally important to show evidence of other skills, including life skills, for example being self-motivated, being able to finish difficult tasks you've set for yourself (sport, music, art, volunteering, extra learning), and getting on with other people.
        ANSWER: False.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Your degree grade is important, but it's equally important to show evidence of other skills, including life skills, for example being self-motivated, being able to finish difficult tasks you've set for yourself (sport, music, art, volunteering, extra learning), and getting on with other people.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: When I was active in the SRC, I tried hard to facilitate agreement at the meetings where disagreements emerged.  I felt I was valued for my efforts, and in the end, we sorted out our differences.  I think this is a good example of leadership and working within a team.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These sentences sound tentative, as if the writer isn't quite sure of him/herself.  The weak phrases are:  tried hard; felt I was; I think.<br />
        ANSWER: An active member of the SRC, it was always me who sorted things out at difficult meetings.  I am a proven leader and a highly valued member of any team.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is arrogant, as it doesn't just state what the writer did, it makes value judgements, for example: 'it was always me' (i.e. the others were useless); I am a proven leader; I am a highly valued member of any team.  This kind of language alienates a potential employer, who has to judge whether or not you will fit in with the current workforce.  Arrogance is never popular.<br />
        ANSWER: I facilitated agreements at difficult meetings of the SRC.  This skill was valued by the team and, over my four years on the committee, I learned many lessons about human relations.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This extract is thoughtful.  It doesn't underplay the writer's skills, yet at the same time it displays some humility, for example 'I learned many lessons ...'  This is the option most likely to attract a potential employer.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Was asked to participate in the GU AmDram play.  Auditioned for, and was chosen for, the main role.  Play won Creative Scotland award.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The information is fine, but the style is too wordy. A potential employer needs facts, not the story.
        ANSWER: Played main role in award winning GU AmDram production of King Lear.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This states the facts clearly and professionally.
        ANSWER: GU AmDram King Lear won Creative Scotland award.  I played main role.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Your role should come first, since the CV is about you.  Putting the play first makes the statement about the play.

INTRO <font size="4">Which of the following will be most attractive to employers?</font> 
    QUESTION 0 These examples are from a covering letter asking for an illustration of your teamworking skills.
        ANSWER: Took over chess club.  Organised timetable and players.  Organised competitions, including transport.
        FEEDBACK: This text is far too clipped for a covering letter asking for an illustration of teamworking skills.  There are no teamworking skills demonstrated here.  Organising people is not the same as working in a team.
        ANSWER: Three of us determined to re-invigorate the University of Glasgow chess club.  We identified our individual strengths and played to them. My task was to attract more members.  Between us, we attracted and retained 25 members, organised every aspect of competitions (transport, chess boards, clocks, score cards) and, this year, won the Scottish Universities' annual chess tournament. 
        FEEDBACK: This is an attractive way to set out a considerable achievement.  The teamwork shines through, and the end result is very impressive.
        ANSWER: When I arrived at the university, the chess club was moribund, so three friends and I decided to reinvigorate it.  We attracted many more members, and organised competitions.  This year we won the Scottish Universities' annual chess tournament.
        FEEDBACK: This text says nearly the same as the text above, but the style is conversational rather than professional.  No real detail about teamwork is given, for example, what the writer contributed.  Everything is a little vague.  Remember that an employer is looking for how you write as well as what you write.  Vague writing does not impress.

<p><font size="4">Mr. John Brady</font></p>
    QUESTION 0 What is the matter with this formatting?  You can choose more than one option.
        ANSWER: The 't' in thank you should not be capitalised.
        FEEDBACK: That's not correct.  The 't' in 'thank you' is the start of the letter, so should be capitalised.
        ANSWER: The letter is all one sentence.
        FEEDBACK: That's right, it is, and it should not be.  This text should be three sentences:  Thank you ... next week.  The time ... very well.  I will see you next week.
        ANSWER: The line spacing is incorrect.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  There should be a line space between Dear Mr. Green, and 'Thank you'. 
        ANSWER: The 'y' in 'Yours sincerely' should be capitalised.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  The signing off 'Yours sincerely' is deemed to be a new sentence.
        ANSWER: No room is left for the signature.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  You need a personal signature as well as a typed name.
        ANSWER: The contraction 'I'll' should be 'I will'.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  In a formal letter, don't use contractions.

<p><font size="4"></font></p>
    QUESTION 0 Should the courses taken at the University of Central Wisconsin be listed?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's important to set out the whole breadth of your academic learning.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Stating your degree subject is enough in a CV. <br />
        ANSWER: Yes, but not here.  These courses should be in a 'skills' part of your CV.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Stating your degree subject is enough in a CV.  The skills section lists what skills you acquired.  These skills will spin off from, but not necessarily be the same as, the courses taken.<br />
        ANSWER: No - setting out courses, unless specifically asked to do so, is unnecessary in a CV.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A CV is an outline of your achievements, experience and skills.  It is not the place for course details.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Call me!
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  You might text this to a friend, but such an order would not endear you to a potential employer.
        ANSWER: Please could you call me next week, to confirm you have my letter?
        FEEDBACK: This is not appropriate.  If you want confirmation, it's up to you to get it.  Asking a potential employer to do something for you will often send your letter and CV into the trash.  
        ANSWER: I will telephone next week to confirm that my application was received.

    QUESTION 0 The language used in this text is grammatically correct and the message is clear.  But is it suitable to send to a potential employer?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's good to present yourself as efficient and businesslike.
        FEEDBACK: It is certainly good to present yourself as efficient and businesslike, but this text sounds exasperated and cross.  You may well need to know if you're going to get an interview, but hectoring the potential employer is unlikely to trigger anything but a negative response.

        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  It is certainly good to present yourself as efficient and businesslike, but this text sounds exasperated and cross.

It is a real imposition, I know, particularly when you are not actually advertising any jobs, but I would be so grateful for the opportunity. Thank you in advance.<br /><br />Yours hopefully,<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Would this text be likely to appeal to a potential employer?
        ANSWER: No.  
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It's annoyingly apologetic and pleading.  It would not encourage a potential employer to pick up the telephone. Even when chasing someone up, remember that you're showcasing your skills.  Keep your language polite, clear but also dignified.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think this text is apologetic and pleading, and would not encourage a potential employer to pick up the telephon.  Even when chasing someone up, remember that you're showcasing your skills.  Keep your language polite, clear but also dignified.

        ANSWER: Hi, Devinda Singh here.  Just following up my letter of last week.  Can you tell me if I'm likely to get an interview or not?
        FEEDBACK: This would not be a good opening gambit.  You give your name, but the person at the other end of the phone is unlikely to be the person to whom you wrote, and even if it was, many letters will have arrived since yours.  Nor do you specify the job for which you've applied.  If you make a call, write down in advance what you're going to say, making sure you include all relevant details.  You've just got the one chance, so make it work.
        ANSWER: Hello, I wonder whether I could speak to Ann Absworth in Human Resources, please.  My name is Devinda Singh.  I wrote to her on 12th January, and said that I would call.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good choice, and has a good a chance as any of working.  If, after such a polite and open approach, you don't get through, you are in a strong position to try again.  If it doesn't work at all, you know you have done your best and that your approach has been professional and dignified.  That's no mean feat in itself.
        ANSWER: Hello.  Ann Absworth, please.
        FEEDBACK: This gets marks for chutzpah, but might backfire as it sounds a little peremptory.  Not a bad choice, but I don't think it's the best choice here.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Hello, I'm ringing about the job advertised on 4th January.  Can I speak to Mrs. Jones in the HR department, please.
        FEEDBACK: This sounds like a first approach, which yours is not.  Also, put yourself in the shoes of the person at the other end of the phone. Being brisk is fine, but I think this is a little too brisk for a job applicant.  
        ANSWER: Hi, Mrs. Jones, please.
        FEEDBACK: This tone is more suited to a senior, longstanding member of staff.  A potential new recruit needs to adopt a less brisk approach. 
        ANSWER: Hello.  I wonder if I could speak to Mrs. Jones in HR?  I've applied to be a junior trainee, and her letter indicated that we were meant to hear back within a fortnight.   I've heard nothing and thought I'd better ring to make sure I haven't missed something.
        FEEDBACK: I think this is the best option here.  It's polite, whilst making your concern clear. Through the suggestion that you may have 'missed something', you are neatly not blaming Mrs. Jones.  She may, however, feel slightly guilty at not keeping her word.

    QUESTION 0 Do all sizes of envelopes require the same postage?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Postage is postage.
        FEEDBACK: I wish that were true, but it's not.  A4 sized envelopes always need a different stamp to smaller envelopes, even the A4 sized envelope contains only one piece of paper.
        ANSWER: No.  They require different stamps.

    QUESTION 1 Is it ok to guess the weight of the envelope and stick on as many stamps as you feel certain will cover the cost?
        ANSWER: Yes.

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Whilst it's certainly not wrong to fold your CV, it looks much better if it's flat and unfolded.  I'd use a bigger envelope.

        ANSWER: Write 'To Whom it May Concern'?
        FEEDBACK: This is not a good idea.  Finding the correct name and title usually involves one telephone call.  Make that call.
        ANSWER: Just send it to the company: the person who opens the mail will give it to the appropriate person.
        FEEDBACK: This is not a good choice.  Letters addressed only to the company may well go straight in the bin.  Do a little research and find the name of an appropriate addressee.

        ANSWER: Subject:  internship    Dear Mr. Higgs,  I would like to be considered for the internship in your firm, advertised online through my university website.  I have some experience designing, building, installing and testing software and hardware, having worked for AmbroIT over the summer.  An internship with your firm offers a chance to broaden my experience and skills in my chosen area of work.  I understand that the internship is unpaid, but the chance to work in a firm such as yours would be invaluable.  As requested, I attach my CV.   with best wishes,  Katrina Kallanova  07899 478 393
        FEEDBACK: This is a professional and workmanlike approach.  There's a tiny bit of personal information about previous experience.  Without flagging up the lack of pay unduly, the writer lets the reader know she has fully understood that the internship does not come with a salary.   She has provided a mobile number.  This is the best of the options here.<br /><br />
        ANSWER: Subject: advertisement for internship in the Guardian   Hi Mr. Higgs, saw your advert on my uni website and I'm really interested in an internship in your firm.  I've some experience in IT, having worked in AmbioIT over the summer.  Nevertheless, I'd really like an internship with you.  Hope to hear from you soon, Jim
        FEEDBACK: This email looks careless.  The subject is too long - 'internship' will do.  The tone implies a slightly cocky, breezy confidence, almost as if the writer was doing the potential employer a favour.  Don't shorten 'university' to 'uni'.  The word 'nevertheless' implies the sub-text 'I'm a bit grand for an internship'.  The signing off 'I hope to hear from you soon' irritates some employers, as it is a metaphorical poke in the ribs before the potential employer has had a chance to draw breath.  Also, no mention of a CV.  If you've attached yours as requested, say so, if only because it will remind you to do it.  The worst option here.<br /><br />
        ANSWER: Subject: internship  Dear Sir or Madam,  I saw your advertisement for an internship and would like to apply.  I attach my CV.  Yours sincerely, Adele McManus
        FEEDBACK: This is a perfectly serviceable response but may appear a little idle to an employer.  From the word go, you must try to catch the employer's attention.  This email certainly doesn't.  Not the best option here.

INTRO <p><font size="4">You've got through to the second round of interviews with two PR and marketing firms.  They've both asked you to come in for a second interview on the same date and at the same time.  You are anxious to go to both interviews if possible. Which of the following emails is likely to achieve that result?</font> </p>
<p><font size="4">Some browsers may delete all the paragraphing in these examples.  If you are sending an email, remember to paragraph just as you would a letter. </font></p>
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Subject: sod's law  Dear Mr. Grant, I'm really sorry, but I've now got two second interviews on the same day at the same time.  I'm really hoping that you might be able to change?  Just let me know what other time might suit you and I'll try my best to be there.  Sorry!  Yours sincerely, Adam Gerrity
        FEEDBACK: The email doesn't start well.  The subject, 'sod's law'  may be apt but it could seem trite or rude.  In the text, anything that begins 'I'm really sorry' has the reader's heart sinking.  After that, the tone is irritatingly ingratiating:  'I'm really hoping' instead of simply 'I'm hoping'.  If the employer gives you another time-slot, you won't TRY to be there:  you'll be there.  Not a good option.<br />
        ANSWER: Subject: second interview 20th February  Dear Mr. Grant,  I am very pleased to be offered a second interview with Grant & Co. and am very keen indeed to return.  As you may imagine, with so much competition for every job, I have not limited my applications to one, and the time offered for the second interview coincides with another.  I do not, however, want to lose the opportunity of meeting you again.  Would it be possible to come in at 4 p.m. instead of 2 p.m. or at any time on Thursday 21st February?  Yours sincerely, James Jones
        FEEDBACK: This email is very positive in tone.  It doesn't skirt around the awkwardness of the situation but leaves the employer feeling that you've dealt with it as best you can.  You've offered other times, which is the professional thing to do.  If you lose the chance of the interview, you'll know that it was just one of those things, and not because you didn't try your best.  This is the best option here.<br />
        ANSWER: Subject: interview clash  Dear Mr. Grant,  Annoyingly, the time you've suggested for my second interview coincides with my second interview elsewhere.  Obviously, I don't want to blow my chances with you!  Could we rearrange?  Yours sincerely,  Brian Goldman
        FEEDBACK: The subject of this email is true, but not well-chosen.  A potential employer needs to feel that it's their job you want.  Make the subject neutral.  The first sentence could be read as you being annoyed with Mr. Grant, and should be rephrased.  The rest of the email is too colloquial - 'blow my chances'.  The question 'can we rearrange' is used more often between friends or existing colleagues.  You need to work a bit harder to remedy the situation.  Suggesting another time/day would help.  After all, you don't want the same situation to arise again.  Not the best option here.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Dear Mr. Rusbridge,  Writing about the job as junior planning officer and attach my CV as requested.  Really hope I get an interview.  Best, Andy Anderson
        FEEDBACK: Writing incomplete sentences, e.g. 'writing about the job' instead of 'I am writing about the job' looks sloppy.  'Really hope I get an interview' doesn't sound keen, which is the writer's hope.  Rather, it sounds a bit desperate.  Use your whole name (Andrew), not its diminutive (Andy).
        ANSWER: Hi Mr. Rubsbridge, I'm writing about the job as junior planning officer.  As requested, my CV's attached.  Thanking you in advance for your time.    Very best, Andy Anderson
        FEEDBACK: 'Hi' is too informal, as are the contractions 'I'm' and 'CV's'.  These should be 'I am' and 'CV is'.  Thanking people in advance is irritatingly meaningless and would have some employers grinding their teeth. 'Very best' could be used once you've secured the job.  Otherwise, stick to 'Yours sincerely'.  Use your whole name (Andrew), not its diminutive (Andy).
        ANSWER: Dear Mr. Rusbridge,  Job 411/23  I am writing to apply for the job of junior planning officer, and attach my CV as requested.  I note the timetable of two weeks for a response.  Yours sincerely,  Andrew Anscombe
        FEEDBACK: This is formal but not pompous.  It is also properly referenced and the writer has used his full name.  This is the best option here.

        ANSWER: Dear Mr. Hardcastle, I'm so sorry but my bus has broken down so though I left plenty of time, I'm now running late.  I should be with you in around half an hour.  I realise that this will be very inconvenient for you, and can only apologise again.  Yours sincerley, Adele Hooper
        FEEDBACK: This is a good option.  The text retains a sense of formality and displays good manners.  When things go wrong, the tone in which you inform a potential employer is very important.  This tone is fine.  This is the best option here.
        ANSWER: Running late - apologies - with you soon I hope Adele
        FEEDBACK: This is polite, but the tone is more suitable for keeping a friend waiting for coffee.  It would elicit a grunt of annoyance from an employer rather than an 'oh dear, the poor girl must be frantic', which is the response you want.  
        ANSWER: Really sorry!!! Bus broken down!!! With you soon! Adele

<p><font size="4">Thanks a lot!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Kirsty</font></p>
    QUESTION 0 From what you can gather from the content of this response, is the tone of this email appropriate.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is clearly a response to an invitation to come for an interview.  An interview is a formal event, so however thrilled you are to get an interview, keep your response formal.  It is fine to call your correspondent 'Malcolm', if that's how he's signed his email to you, but 'Hi' is much too familiar.  Even if Malcolm himself wrote 'Hi', at this stage you should use 'Dear'.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. This is clearly a response to an invitation to come for an interview.  An interview is a formal event, so however thrilled you are to get an interview, keep your response formal.  It is fine to call your correspondent 'Malcolm', if that's how he's signed his email to you, but 'Hi' is much too familiar.  Even if Malcolm himself wrote 'Hi', at this stage you should use 'Dear'.
    QUESTION 1 Is it acceptable to use contractions (thanks, I'm, you've) in an emailed response to a call for interview?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  At this stage, you need to be formal.  It's fine to express enthusiasm, but do so formally, e.g. Thank you; I am really pleased; you have chosen me.  
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  At this stage, you need to be formal.  It's fine to express enthusiasm, but do so formally, e.g. Thank you; I am really pleased; you have chosen me.
    QUESTION 2 There's another error in this email.  What is it?
        ANSWER: Kirsty hasn't written 'Yours sincerely'.
        FEEDBACK: You're right.  She hasn't.  I think she should have done, but that's not the error that's most concerning.
        ANSWER: Exclamation marks.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Exclamation marks are never a good idea in a formal response. Exclamation marks are far too ubiquitous in all email correspondence.  Scattering them like confetti makes you look ditsy - not a good look for a potential employee.    
        ANSWER: The email is too short.
        FEEDBACK: No.  Short is excellent so long as the email says all it needs to say.  No employer wants to waste time on padding.

        FEEDBACK: This is so clearly a generic email that's going to be sent on the rounds that even if a firm had been thinking of offering you an interview, they might now think again.  A poor option.

        FEEDBACK: This email starts well, but then dissolves.  Don't try to flatter the email's recipient meaningless phrases and promises you've no idea if you could keep.  Also, don't thank in anticipation.  This really annoys employers as it's a very crude form of attempted manipulation.  Finally, make sure you put your last name in the body of the email.  Many Andrews may have applied.
        ANSWER: Dear Mr. Dundonald,  As requested in your email, I attach my CV and covering letter as part of my application for a traineeship with Dundonald and Roberts.  I note that there is no timetable given for application processing, and wonder if it might be possible to let me know approximately when I might hear whether I have got through to the interview stage?  Yours sincerely, Andrew Pearce
        FEEDBACK: This option shows some thought.  The firm's name is mentioned, so this is clearly not a generic email.  The language used is professional, and the question is asked politely.  The tone of this email makes it likely that Mr. Dundonald would feel it polite to reply.

        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  There should be a colon.
        ANSWER: Yes, there should be a colon.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.
    QUESTION 1 Should the colon come after 'treaties' or after '1815'?
        ANSWER: The colon should come after 1815.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  The colon should come after 'treaties'.  Colons introduce a list, and although there are only two treaties in this list, it is still a list.  The text makes that clear by saying 'it [the treaty] was a base for later treaties', before giving us the two examples.
        ANSWER: The colon should come after 'treaties'.
        FEEDBACK: This is correct.  The colon should come after 'treaties'.  Colons introduce a list, and although there are only two treaties in this list, it is still a list.  The text makes that clear by saying 'it [the treaty] was a base for later treaties', before giving us the two examples.
    QUESTION 2 Do we need that semi-colon after '1815'?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  No punctuation is needed here.  The text flows better without.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the text flows better without.  You only need a semi-colon when the reader needs a slightly more emphatic pause than a comma provides. Here, no pause is required.

INTRO  <font size="4">The 'chansons de geste' take 'chivalric ethos' as their subject matter. This 'ethos' includes many virtues. These 'virtues' were important to knights, as we can see through the &quot;Arthurian knights&quot; and those who followed in their footsteps. It's the stories, though, that bring these &quot;heroes&quot; to life: that &quot;distinctive touch of chivalry&quot;<sup>1</sup> displayed by Roland, for example, as he met his death.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should 'chansons de geste' be enclosed in quotation marks?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's a foreign term.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Though this term might once have been italicised as a foreign term, nowadays, this is a perfectly ordinary historical term.  It would never have needed quotation marks.
        ANSWER: No.  This term has never needed quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Though this term might once have been italicised as a foreign term, nowadays, this is a perfectly ordinary historical term.  It would never have needed quotation marks.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter.  Formatting is important because it brings you into line with the academic community of which you are part.  Though this term might once have been italicised as a foreign term, nowadays, this is a perfectly ordinary historical term.  It would never have needed quotation marks.
    QUESTION 1 Should 'chivalric ethos', 'ethos' and 'virtues' be enclosed in quotation marks?
        ANSWER: Yes, all of them.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  None needs quotation marks.  They are not quotations, just words.
        ANSWER: 'Chivalric ethos' and 'ethos' do, but 'virtue' does not.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  None of these words need quotation marks.  They are not quotations:  they are just words.
        ANSWER: None of them need quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  They are all just words, not quotations, so they don't need quotation marks.
    QUESTION 2 Does the term 'Arthurian knights' need quotation marks?
        ANSWER: That's a matter of choice.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not.  This term does not need quotation marks for the simple reason that it is not a quotation.
        ANSWER: Yes, it does.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This term does not need quotation marks for the simple reason that it is not a quotation.
        ANSWER: No, it doesn't.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This term does not need quotation marks for the simple reason that it is not a quotation.
    QUESTION 3 There is something wrong with two sets of quotation marks in this passage, regardless of whether the quotation marks themselves are needed.  What is it?
        ANSWER: Quotation marks should all be double and not single.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  It's the other way round.
        ANSWER: Quotation marks should be single and not double.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. Quotation marks should always be single unless you have a quotation within a quotation.  That's the only time you use double quotation marks.
    QUESTION 4 Does 'the distinctive touch of chivalry' need quotation marks?
        ANSWER: No.  
        FEEDBACK: The phrase is a quotation, as we can see from the footnote reference number, so it does need quotation marks.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  This is a quotation.  It would need quotation marks (single) and a footnote.

    QUESTION 0 Is the rest of the punctuation correct?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Since the quotation isn't integrated into the general text, it should be introduced with a colon, not a comma.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Since the quotation isn't integrated into the general text, it should be introduced with a colon, not a comma.
    QUESTION 1 Are the quotation marks in this text correct?
        ANSWER: Yes.

    QUESTION 2 Is there anything missing from this text?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  After the quotation, there should be a number relating to a footnote that would appear at the bottom of the page.  Never include a quotation without a related footnote.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sets of quotation marks has been correctly used?
        ANSWER: All of them are correctly used.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect. 
        ANSWER: None of them are correctly used.
        FEEDBACK: This is correct.  Foreign expressions like ancien regime should be italicised but not stuck between quotation marks. The other terms are names, and names do not need quotation marks.
        ANSWER: The French phrase ancien regime should be enclosed in quotation marks but nothing else.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Foreign phrases should be italicised but not placed within quotation marks unless they are direct quotations from a text.

INTRO  <font size="4">King James VI became king of England in 1603; and England is where many historians believe his heart was; Jenny Wormald explains how James became; 'the king who had turned his back on his first kingdom, in the interests of ... his second.'<sup>1</sup> James's creation of a national flag, the Union Jack, was made in vain; although in 1606 he ordered the flag to be sued for royal and merchant shipping, the southern Britons still flew the cross of St. George; and the northern Britons the cross of St. Andrew. <br /><br /></font>
    QUESTION 0 Is it right to put a semi-colon in front of the quotation, as is done here?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If a quotation need to be introduced with a punctuation mark, it would be a colon. 
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  If a quotation needs to be introduced with a punctuation mark, it would be a colon.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal preference.
        FEEDBACK: Sadly not.  There are rules.  In this case, if a quotation is to be introduced with a punctuation mark, it should be a colon.  But the rules were not made up arbitrarily.   A colon offers more of a pause than a semi-colon.  Press the blue question mark above the exercises for more information.
    QUESTION 1 Are the first two semi-colons correctly placed?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  We don't need the first, and the second should be a full stop.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. We don't need the first and the second should be a full stop.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of choice.
        FEEDBACK: Sadly not.  The first sentence of the example is too broken up by the semi-colon in the middle, and the semi-colon at the end isn't strong enough.  We need a full stop. Rules about punctuation are not arbitrary, however.  They are designed for clarity.
    QUESTION 2 Is the semi-colon between 'vain' and 'although' the correct punctuation?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  'Although' starts a sub-clause, so a full stop is needed after 'in vain', which is a whole sentence in itself.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.   A semi-colon is usually clumsy before a sub-clause, and 'although' introduced a sub-clause.  Better to put a full stop after 'in vain' and create two complete sentences.
        ANSWER: Debatable.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  There are two complete sentences here, requiring division by full stop.

In return for Edward's help, he demanded that all the competitors recognise him as their overlord.</font>

        FEEDBACK: This is correct, but you'd not guess so from the text.
    QUESTION 1 Who, in return for Edward's help, demanded that the other competitors recognise him as their overlord?
        ANSWER: Floris count of Holland and Hastings.
        FEEDBACK: I don't think that's quite right.  Apart from anything else, Floris was Count of Holland.  Hasting was somebody quite different:  he was John Hastings.
        ANSWER: Edward 1.
        FEEDBACK: I think this is what the writer meant, but it is not remotely clear.
    QUESTION 2 What would have made the meaning of this sentence clearer?
        ANSWER: Better punctuation.
        FEEDBACK: Certainly.  We need a colon after 'contesters' (which should be changed to 'contestants').  The contestants need to be separated by semi-colons and there needs to be a comma after Floris and 'Holland' so that it's clear that Floris and Hastings are not the same person.
        ANSWER: Breaking up the text into shorter sentences.
        FEEDBACK: No.  The length of the sentences is fine, provided each sentence is punctuated properly.
        ANSWER: Transposing 'Edward' and 'he' in the second sentence.
        FEEDBACK: Yes.  It should read:  'In return for his help, Edward demanded that all the competitors recognise him as their overlord'.   Keep the main subject with the main clause.  That's usually enough to remove ambiguity.

Why is it that these groups see themselves as separate nationalities when, for example, the Catholic Dutch of the south east Netherlands and the Protestant Dutch of the north west see themselves as being one nationality?

        FEEDBACK: No, it isn't really relevant.  The facts are correct and even interesting, but no attempt has been made to use them to answer the question.  Sadly, this means they are wasted.

        ANSWER: So it can be seen that the Scots regarded the English kings as insignificant factors in their overall belief in an independent kingdom of Scotland.
        FEEDBACK: You couldn't tell, from this concluding line, what the essay question had been.  Not the best choice, I don't think.
        ANSWER: Thus we can see, from the reigns and characters of both Edward 1 and Charles 1, that though they might have had due cause, their roles in stirring up rebellion and civil war in Scotland were not insignificant.
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option, since this concluding line clearly links the essay to the essay title. 
        ANSWER: While some may argue that developing class consciousness played a role in the uprising, I believe that this was shaped directly by the monarch's actions and thus cannot be used as a case to protect them.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line is puzzling, which is never a good thing for a concluding line to be.  It leaves the reader wanting some further explanation and link back to the title of the essay.  This is not a good option.

        ANSWER: Or if it really was, why would the Scots nowadays again prefer their own devolved parliament?
        FEEDBACK: Ending an essay with a rhetorical question is never a good idea.  It's not entirely wrong, but it can irritate by seeming a little glib.
        ANSWER: The ease with which James was able to control Scotland, compared with his grandfather and great grandfather, was more to do with the distraction of Scottish political elites south to the court at London, the removal of the external threat from England and simply, luck.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line is too long the some strange word choices (distraction?) are, in themselves, distracting.  This is the last sentence your marker reads. Aim for clarity.
        ANSWER: It could be concluded that the rebellion was not only opposed against the Catholic religion but also against the action of the French arm in the Scottish government.
        FEEDBACK: This is a perplexing sentence, which needs decyphering rather than reading.  'Opposed against'? the 'French arm'? It's never a good thing to leave a marker scratching their head.  Neither does the line echo the essay title.  Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: Thus, through the examining the reigns of James III and James IV, and comparing these reigns with the reign of James VI and I, this essay has shown that the union of the crowns increased the crown's difficulties, and thus paved the way for the disasters that followed.
        FEEDBACK: I liked this concluding line.  It echoed the title of the essay and also showed that the writer, though entirely focused, had a sense of the broader sweep of history.

        ANSWER: Therefore, it is impossible to say what was the most important factor in the development of knightly ethos in eleventh and twelfth century Europe.
        FEEDBACK: Endings like this are not wrong, but they are unsatisfactory, and tend to leave the marker feeling that you haven't thought hard enough about the subject.  Having done your research and written your essay, you should have some view.  This is not a good option.  
        ANSWER: So, all in all, I think the development of romance was really important for the development of knightly ethos.  
        FEEDBACK: The idea behind this line is fine, but the line itself is too informal for an academic essay.   It might read better as:  In conclusion, courtly love seems the most important factor in the development of knightly ethos in eleventh and twelfth century Europe.
        ANSWER: Thus it would seem that from the three factors identified at the beginning of this essay as essential to the development of knightly ethos in eleventh and twelfth century  Europe, the church emerges as the major one.
        FEEDBACK: This does the job of a concluding line perfectly professionally.   The essay topics are referred to but not listed and a view is taken.  This is the best option of the three offered here.

        ANSWER: The crown was evidently far stronger in 1625 than it had been in 1567, yet as Julian Goodare argues, there appear to be few tangible developments in the governance of Scotland that are the direct consequence of union. (reference)   It is difficult to argue, therefore, that the union of the crowns made it easier for a Scottish monarch to govern the Scottish realm.  Indeed, as this essay has shown, union simply produced a whole new set of difficulties to which, when absenteeism was added, a British monarch had to attempt to find a new set of solutions. 
        FEEDBACK: These lines reflect the title of the essay and bring a sense of positive closure.  The reference is cleverly placed to add weight to the essay at this final stage.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: As James was both king of Scotland and England, it is difficult to measure the ease of his rule over the Scottish realm in comparison with other monarchs. He just had to try and make it work.
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines sit firmly on the fence.  The essay writer seems to have concluded nothing, which is a shame.  These lines are not the best option.
        ANSWER: James VI and 1's decisions proved both popular and unpopular, making his rule both easier and more difficult.  His absence from Scotland was unpopular.  His promise not to make changes gained him respect. The union of the crowns could, therefore, be said to have made his rule over the realm both easier and more difficult.
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines are a complete fudge.  The writer needs to take a stance one way or the other.  These lines would irritate a marker no end.

        ANSWER: Changes in the structure of society together with the crusades increased intolerance in the twelfth century.  Laymen and clerics did not scruple to use evidence of private non-conformity to add weight to any accusation they cared to make.  Thus, non-conformity became a vulnerability, a reason to live in fear.
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines are fine, but they don't quite nail the question asked in the essay title.  Reading them, it would be hard to tell exactly what the essay title was.  Not bad, but not the best.
        ANSWER: Thus, the extent to which medieval society was tolerant of non-conformity depended on the level of threat perceived by the church to its own authority, and since this was under constant review, toleration could never, even in times apparently peaceful, be guaranteed. 
        FEEDBACK: By making a simple statement, this line, though a little long, finishes the essay off nicely, giving the marker/reader a satisfactory sense of closure.  This is the best option here.
        ANSWER: Medieval society was never tolerant of non-conformity, and society is not much better today.
        FEEDBACK: This is a personal opinion. Although tempting to use as a concluding line because it carries a punch, I'm afraid it has no place in an academic essay

        ANSWER: James VI's rule over multiple monarchies and move to England meant he did not have any power over law and order and increasingly lost touch with public opinion over religion in Scotland causing an uprising against the crown through riots and propaganda.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is far too long and incoherent for the body of the essay, let alone the concluding lines.  Concluding lines must feel like a gathering up of points made, but in a measured way.  This is a gabble.  If the sentence were divided, it would improve its concluding qualities.  As it stands, this is a very poor concluding line.
        ANSWER: Thus, governing Scotland in the late middle ages was a balancing act:  nobles and king; law and tyranny;  religious dogmatism and religious pragmatism.  The peaceful governance of Scotland depended on this balance, and if no monarch was ultimately successful, this is perhaps less as a result of personal failure, and more because the task was impossible.
        FEEDBACK: This is a neat wrapping up of the topics chosen for discussion in the essay, echoes the wording of the essay title and has a nice sense of closure.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: I think Scotland was not well governed then, and it is not now, which is why we should back full independence and be allowed another chance.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too general and too personal.  An academic essay should certainly take a view, but the view has to be kept within the confines of the essay title and not spill over into the polemical.

        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, therefore, the creation of the burghs and the trade this encouraged was not only responsible for the emergence of the middling sorts, it was integral to the shaping of Scotland itself.
        FEEDBACK: This has a nice 'wrapped up' feel to it, making a big statement which leaves the reader satisfied.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: Burgh-based trade led to political stability, allowing the middling sorts to urbanise, it lead to economic stability which provided the middling sorts with numerous monetary advantages like jobs, currency and increased domestic and international trade, and finally burgh-based trade led to the consolidation of royal authority which aided in creating a common Scottish identity and consciousness for a growing middle sorts social group.
        FEEDBACK: First of all, this sentence is far, far too long.  It would be much better split into at least three small sentences.  Secondly, concluding lines draw arguments together but shouldn't simply repeat them.  Sometimes, recapitulation is good, to remind the reader of the main points of the essay.  But recapitulation should never turn into a sentence like this.  This is not a good choice. 
        ANSWER: The middling sorts were predominantly traders.  Therefore the growth of burgh-based trade was quite important in the creation of this new social group.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are very plodding, and the inclusion of the word 'quite' leaves the reader feeling that the writer is sitting on the fence.  Be bold.  Take a stance and finish with a carefully considered flourish.

        ANSWER: International trade was something else that increased when the burghs were created.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good linking sentence, reflecting the theme of the previous paragraph.  The use of the word 'also' makes the paragraph transition smooth.
        ANSWER: It is believed that the earliest burghs were created during the reign of King David 1.
        FEEDBACK: This does link with the previous paragraph, in that both talk about the creation of the burghs. However, this sentence seems in the wrong place.  It feels as though it should have come at the beginning of the essay, not in the middle of a detailed discussion about cash and mints.
        ANSWER: The middling sorts began to take up influential positions in the law and the kirk.

        ANSWER: This exposure to the rest of Europe had a number of consequences for the middling sorts of Scotland.

        ANSWER: English monarchs have been involved in the shaping of medieval and early modern Scotland, sometimes manipulating internal struggles for their own ends and at other times unintentionally uniting a nation in rebellion against them.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good opening line.  It echoes the terms of the question, and opens up two promising areas for discussion in the body of the essay.
        ANSWER: Throughout medieval and early modern Scotland, English monarchs tended to be involved in Scottish affairs.
        FEEDBACK: This would be fine if followed by specific examples.   With examples, it would carry weight.  Left hanging, it doesn't add anything.
        ANSWER: England and Scotland share much more than a common border, as we can see from the influence they have had on each other over the years, culturally, socially and politically.
        FEEDBACK: This statement, though undoubtedly true, is far too general.  An opening line needs to get straight into the question.  Not a good choice.

        ANSWER: Throughout history, Scotland and England have had a trouble relationship to say the least.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line doesn't really grab the attention, or say anything at all.  If, when you reread your essay, you find you can miss out the opening line without any loss to the essay, delete it and turn the first relevant line into the opening line. You will not be alone in adopting this technique.
        ANSWER: Since they came into existence, Scotland and England have been at war with each other many times, approximately up until the 18th century.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is far too general.  The title asks for 'at least two periods' to be identified.  These two periods should be identified, rather than just a vague reference to the 18th century.
        ANSWER: This essay will try to answer the question 'Did Scots resist closer ties with England purely for patriotic reasons'.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is a waste of words.  Echoing the terms of the question is one thing;  simply repeating it quite another.  Avoid this style of opening.
        ANSWER: The uprising of William Wallace and the 'middling sorts' of 1297, and events leading up to the 1502 Treaty of Perpetual Peace signed by James IV of Scotland and Henry VII of England are fertile territory in any discussion about the role Scottish patriotism played in Scots resistance to closer ties with England.

        ANSWER: 'The grant of burghal status conferred protection and privilege, ensuring that trade would thrive in areas designated by the king.'1
        FEEDBACK: This quote is well chosen since it echoes, at least in part, the essay question.  The next line would need to link this quote directly to the rise of the middling sorts.  That would make a very good start.
        ANSWER: The social structure of Scotland has changed vastly over the centuries, with the emergence of definitive social classes.
        FEEDBACK: This is too general.  The question asks specifically about medieval and early modern Scotland.  It's sometimes tempting to make a generalisation at the start of an essay, but it never creates a good impression.
        ANSWER: Any examination of 'the middling sorts' in medieval and early modern Scotland has to address their political as well as economic growth.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line launches the reader straight into the essay.  It is punchy, contains an argument and echoes the terms of the question. This is the best option.
        ANSWER: The growth of burgh-based trade within medieval and early modern Scotland played a role in the emergence of the 'middling sorts' during this time.

        FEEDBACK: This opening line lacks punch and adds nothing to the essay.  A good opening line should get straight to the point.  This is not a particularly good choice.
        ANSWER: In 11th and 12th centuries, knightly ethos developed in many different ways.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line is padding - repeating the terms of the question but adding nothing.  Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: There are three main factors in the development of knightly ethos in 11th and 12th century Europe:  the church, the increasing sophistication of the lay aristocracy; and contemporary attitudes to women.

        ANSWER: Tolerance can be described as 'allowing a person, religious sect or opinion to exist without interference or molestation'. (footnoted reference)
        FEEDBACK: This is a perfectly acceptabel opening, since defining tolerance is important in the context of this essay.
        ANSWER: In medieval society, where church and state inextricably linked, the tolerance of lay society to non-conformity depended largely on the tolerance or otherwise of the church.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line gets straight to the point which the essay is going to argue.  Of the choices here, this is the best option.
        ANSWER: Whether in medieval or modern times, life has always been difficult for those whose life-styles don't conform to what society defines as 'the norm'.
        FEEDBACK: This statement may be true, but is padding.  Removing it would not detract from the essay.   It is too general an opening line, so not the best choice here.

        ANSWER: St. Francis was born in Assisi in 1182.
        FEEDBACK: This statement may be true, but bears little relation to the essay title.  If you feel this information is important, it is better to incorporate it into more relevant references, rather than give it a line on its own.
        ANSWER: The monastic tradition dated back to St. Benedict of Nursia, who began as a hermit but, when joined by companions, formed the first monastic community in the west.
        FEEDBACK: This is an informative first line, but would pack more of a punch if the essay question itself was addressed.  Not a bad beginning but not the best.  
        ANSWER: It is tempting to draw clear distinctions between the monastic tradition, essentially one of withdrawal from the world, and the type of religious life advocated by St. Francis, which sought to engage with the world - albeit as a conduit to the next.
        FEEDBACK: This line, though a trifle long, hits the ground running.  It outlines the key difference between traditional monasticism and Franciscan monasticism, and opens the essay up in a lively way.  This is the best choice here.

Every choice has an explanation, so if you find our preferred option quickly, it is still worth browsing through them all.

        ANSWER: It has been argued by some historians that Henry IV caused the rift between the German monarchy and the papacy during the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries.
        FEEDBACK: This isn't wrong, but it is really just a restatement of the essay question.  Always try and add something, so that the opening line doesn't seem like padding.  This isn't the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Although it is easy to blame Henry IV for the rift between the German monarchy and the papacy during the late eleventh and early twelfth century, at least two other factors were major contributors.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good opening line: it echoes the terms of the question and adds something more.  A reader wants to read on, to discover which two factors the writer has identified. Stirring up a reader's interest is a great virtue in an opening line.
        ANSWER: Henry IV became the emperor of Germany in 1056 and Pope Gregory VII, the pope with whom he came into conflict, was elected to the papacy in 1073.
        FEEDBACK: The information imparted here is correct, but of no direct relevance to the essay question.  A marker would skip over it, which is never a good thing.  This is not the best choice.

INTRO  <font size="4">After his return, James's competent rule, his fearsome reputation (possibly modeled on Henry V) and his links with other European dynasties (through the arranged marriages of two daughters), increased the reluctance of the English to meddle.<br /><br />When Mary came to the throne (1588), Scotland was in danger of being absorbed by France. Mary was married to the Dauphin [sic] and had a double claim on the English throne (through Henry VII and Mary Tudor (Henry VIII's sister)) which the French supported.<br /><br />In 1557, a group of Scottish protestants formed the Lords of Congregation [sic]. <br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Are the brackets round the dates used correctly?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct, although it wouldn't be entirely wrong to enclose 1588 in brackets.  Better to keep it in the main text, though.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Well, it's debatable.  It wouldn't be entirely wrong to enclose 1588 in brackets, but it would be better to include the date in the main text.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: It always matters.  Make a choice.  You may have to defend your choice to your marker.
    QUESTION 1 Are both sets of square brackets used properly?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  You don't need square brackets in either of these instances. The word 'Dauphin' and the phrase 'Lords of Congregation' are neither quotations, nor in need of any kind of special attention.
        ANSWER: One is, one isn't.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Neither are used properly.  Neither the word 'Dauphin' nor the phrase 'Lords of Congregation' are quotations, and even if they were, neither are in need of special attention.
        ANSWER: No, neither are used properly.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Neither the word 'Dauphin' nor the phrase 'Lords of Congregation' are quotations, and even if they were, neither are in need of special attention.
    QUESTION 2 Are the brackets round the explanation of the double claim to the throne correctly used?
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: No, not in this instance.  The brackets are incorrectly used.  If this information is important enough to include in the essay, it shouldn't be confined to brackets.  In this case, too, the double bracket enclosing yet more information clutters the text in an unhelpful way.
        ANSWER: Yes.

    QUESTION 0 Is the footnote properly styled?
        ANSWER: Yes.

        ANSWER: Doesn't matter in this context.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it always matters.  This is not to irritate, but to make sure that citations can easily be checked.
    QUESTION 1 Which of the following is the correct formatting for this footnote?
        ANSWER: 1 G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce 4th edn, (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), p.71
        FEEDBACK: All is correct here, except for the title of the book, Robert Bruce, which should be italicised.
        ANSWER: 1 Barrow, G. W. S., ROBERT BRUCE, Edition 4, p.71, Edinburgh University Press.
        FEEDBACK: Almost everything here is incorrect.  In a footnote, the first name, or initials, of the author should come first.  A book title should never be wholly capitalised;  it should be italicised.  The edition number is shortened to 4th edn.;  we need the place of publication, publisher and date of publication in brackets, followed by the page number of the quotation.

    QUESTION 0 Is the superscript footnote number in the right place?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It should come before the full stop.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  If the superscript footnote number comes at the end of the sentence, it should come after the final bit of punctuation - in this case the full stop.
        ANSWER: No.  It should come after the full stop.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.
    QUESTION 1 Since there is no direct quote, is a footnote needed at all?
        ANSWER: Yes.    
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  Hobsbaum's argument may have been quoted in reported speech rather than directly, but his argument has still beeb cited and so must be referenced.  
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right. Hobsbaum's argument may have been quoted in reported speech rather than directly, but his argument has still been cited and so must be referenced.
    QUESTION 2 In the footnote, is the title of the book correctly capitalised?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Every word of this title should be capitalised except for 'and'.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct. Click on the blue question mark above the exercises in the 'Formatting - capitals' section of this site for further explanation.  
        ANSWER: No.  'Since' should not be capitalised.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  'Since' is a subordinating conjunction, and subordinating conjunctions should be capitalised.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises in the 'Formatting - capitals' section of this site for further explanation.
    QUESTION 3 Is there anything missing from this footnote?
        ANSWER: No, it's complete.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not quite complete.  For the first reference, we need the publisher as well as the city of publication, i.e. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992)
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. For the first reference, we need the name of the publisher as well as the city of publication, i.e. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992)
    QUESTION 4 Is the page correctly identified?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Strictly speaking, the page should just be identified with a 'p'.  The point of that is to make footnotes as neat as possible.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  The page should be identified only with 'p'.  This is to make the footnotes as neat as possible.

        FEEDBACK: The dots in this case are unnecessary, although the writer may have included them because he/she felt that what came before 'diplomatic' was important enough for its absence to merit emphasis.
        ANSWER: No.  A quotation is always an extract from something, so ... should only be included if something has been omitted within the quoted text.

        ANSWER: Yes.  The footnote number should come before the full stop.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If the quotation ends the sentence, the footnote number should come after the final piece of punctuation, in this case the full stop.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  When a quotation finishes a sentence, the footnote number should be placed after the final piece of punctuation;  in this case, the full stop.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter where the footnote number comes.
        FEEDBACK: Alas, it does!  The rules about footnote number placement are not arbitrary or just there to catch you out.  Rules have been devised for clarity and sometimes to help printers, if the work is to be published. Consistency is an important part of scholarship.
    QUESTION 1 What is wrong with the footnote itself?
        ANSWER: Nothing.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  In a footnote, the first name or initials of the author come first.  Only in a bibliography does the author's surname come first.  This is because a bibliography lists books in alphabetical order, according to author.  This footnote should read: G.W.S. Barrow, etc.
        ANSWER: The author's initials should come first.

        ANSWER: There should be no brackets.

    QUESTION 0 Are these footnotes or parts of a bibliography?
        ANSWER: Part of a bibliography
        FEEDBACK: No, they are footnotes.  Books listed in a bibliography are not numbered and are listed in alphabetical order, according to the author's surname.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  They are footnotes, and you can tell they are because they are numbered.  Books in a bibliography are not numbered:  they are listed in the alphabetical order of the author's surname.
        ANSWER: Could be either.
        FEEDBACK: No, they couldn't.  Since they are numbered, they must be footnotes.
    QUESTION 1 Are the names of the authors correctly styled for footnotes?

        ANSWER: Galloway, B. is incorrect for a footnote.  Jenny Wormald is correct for a foootnote.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Only in a bibliography are authors' names listed alphabetically by surname.  Jenny Wormald's name is correctly styled for a footnote, with her first name first.

        ANSWER: Yes. 
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Italics are used for the names of books or journals.  Articles within books or journals are placed within inverted commas and not italicised.  In this example, the italics are the wrong way round.

    QUESTION 0 Where should the italics go in this reference?
        ANSWER: The Impact of the New Model Army should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: No.  The title of an article in a book should be enclosed in inverted commas.  The book title should be italicised.
        ANSWER: The publisher should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: No.  Names are never italicised.  In this example, the book title should be italicised, with the article title enclosed in inverted commas.
        ANSWER: The Impact of the English Civil War should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The title of the article should be enclosed in inverted commas and the book title should be italicised.
    QUESTION 1 Is it correct to have a page reference in a bibliography?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Page references should be listed.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  A bibliography is a list of books you have consulted for your essay, whether you have quoted from them or not.  Page references belong in footnotes.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  A bibliography is a list of books you have consulted for your essay, whether you have quoted from them or not.  Page references belong in footnotes.
        ANSWER: You can if you want.
        FEEDBACK: No, it is not a matter of choice.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises to see why this is so.  The real answer is that a bibliography is simply a list of books you have consulted for your essay, whether you have quoted from them or not.  Page references belong in footnotes.
    QUESTION 2 Which is the correct style for the place, publisher and date of publication?
        ANSWER: published in London, Collins and Brown, in 1991
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't correct.
        ANSWER: London, Collins
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't correct.

INTRO Bibliography:<br /><br />Anstruther, G. A., The World of the Cold War, comes in 3 vols published in London by Collins and translated by George Smith. 
    QUESTION 0 Where should the name of the translator go?
        ANSWER: Right at the end.
        FEEDBACK: No, not there.
        ANSWER: After the book title.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The translator's name should be placed directly after the book title, separated from the book title with a comma.
        ANSWER: Right at the beginning of the reference.
        FEEDBACK: No, not there.
    QUESTION 1 What's the correct way to indicate that the book comes in more than one volume?
        ANSWER: Saying 'comes in x volumes'.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.
        ANSWER: After the author or translator's name, just say 'x vols'.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This is all that's necessary.
    QUESTION 2 Is the place of publication, publisher and date correctly styled in this example?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, they're not.  The place of publication, publisher and date should read:  (London:  Collins, 1974)
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The place of publication, publisher and date should read:  (London:  Collins, 1974)

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: War and Peace: How effective has 'people's war' proved in the European context?<br /> <br /> The dismissal of Necker in 1789 as Controller General also displeased the people. This resulted in riots and the storming of the Bastille in 1789. In 1789 the Assembly gathered to restore peace and reforms were passed to satisfy the people. In 1793, the Committee of Public Safety was formed under Maximilian Robespierre. It had twelve members and focused on the protection of France from other European powers. The Committee of Public Safety was formed by the National Convention, which was the first republican government seen in France. The National Convention was formed in 1792.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is this paragraph narrative or analytical?
        ANSWER: Analytical.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not.  The paragraph simply lists events in the French Revolution rather than thinking about the question and then using carefully selected events as illustration.
        ANSWER: Narrative.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. The paragraph simply lists events in the French Revolution rather than thinking about the question and then using carefully selected events as illustration.
    QUESTION 1 Is all this information necessary in the context of the question?
        ANSWER: Yes:  we need all the information, just better presented.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The question asks how effective 'people's war' was, so the essay needs to show how effective the revolution was.  In this respect, much of the information presented, e.g. how many members formed the Committee for Public Safety and many of the dates, are irrelevant.  We need much more analysis of the effects of the revolution and not so many bald facts about the revolution itself.
        ANSWER: No, all this information isn't necessary.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The question asks how effective 'people's war' was, so, having chosen the French Revolution as an example, the essay needs to show how effective it was.  In this respect, much of the information presented, e.g. how many members formed the Committee for Public Safety and many of the dates, are irrelevant.  We need much more analysis of the effects of the revolution and not so many bald facts about the revolution itself.

INTRO <font size="4">This is part of an essay entitled: War and peace: how effective has 'people's war' proved in the European context?<br /><br />The only comparison between World War II and the French revolution is that the majority of people affected by the wars were ordinary people. Whilst the revolution was to their advantage, however, World War II was wholly destructive and ineffective in bringing any benefit to anyone. <br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 This is quite a statement.  Can it stand alone, just as it is?
        ANSWER: Yes, it can stand alone because the writer obviously really believes it to be true.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Such a statement requires loads of evidence as backup if it is to be remotely credible. 
        ANSWER: No.  It is so controversial it would need very very strong factual evidence to back it up.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A reader of such a statement must know on what factual basis it is based.
    QUESTION 1 Are there any places in the essay where this statement might stand alone?
        ANSWER: No.  It would always need evidence.
        FEEDBACK: It's right that such a statement would always need evidence.  However, if the statement was made at the beginning of an essay, the rest of the essay would presumably be spent setting out evidence. If the statement was made at the end of the essay, presumably the essay would have included evidence.  So - the statement might stand either at the beginning or end of the essay, but evidence must be included somewhere. 
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree - but with big qualifications.  If the statement was made at the beginning of an essay, the rest of the essay would presumably be spent setting out evidence. If the statement was made at the end of the essay, presumably the essay would have included evidence.  So - the statement might stand either at the beginning or end of the essay, but evidence must be included somewhere.

INTRO <font size="4">Henry IV was a strong king but spent much of his reign fighting off internal threats. Henry V was more secure, and thus in a better position to become involved in Scottish affairs. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Do either of these statements need specific evidence to back them up?
        ANSWER: No. Both are fine as they stand.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right, I'm afraid.  Both assertions require evidence. We need some proof of Henry IV's strength and a specific internal threat should cited, naming names.  A specific comparison between Henry IV and V should also be alluded to, thus proving that Henry V sat more securely on his throne.
        ANSWER: Yes.  Both need specific evidence to back them up.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  Both assertions require evidence. We need some proof of Henry IV's strength and a specific internal threat should cited, naming names.  A specific comparison between Henry IV and V should also be alluded to, thus proving that Henry V sat more securely on his throne.
        ANSWER: The first assertion needs evidence, the second is fine as it stands.
        FEEDBACK: Afraid not.  Both assertions require evidence. We need some proof of Henry IV's strength and a specific internal threat should cited, naming names.  A specific comparison between Henry IV and V should also be alluded to, thus proving that Henry V sat more securely on his throne.

INTRO <font size="4">It is clear that, during his reign, Balliol was buffeted between his English 'overlord' and his advisers. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Does this statement need evidence to back it up?
        ANSWER: Yes - evidence of the 'buffeting' is needed to strengthen the point.
        FEEDBACK: That's quite right.  Without evidence, this point is very weak.  We need a 'for example' here.
        ANSWER: No - we can take the evidence for granted.  Balliol being Scottish when his overlord was English is evidence enough.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid not.  That assumes too much and history is about evidence, not assumption.  Without evidence, this 'buffeting' point is very weak.  We need a 'for example' here.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of authorial style.
        FEEDBACK: Specific evidence is never a matter of style.  Specific evidence is a matter of necessity.  Without evidence, this 'buffeting' point is very weak.  We need a 'for example' here.

The prevention of hegemony, i.e. when larger states dominate smaller ones, something that ultimately transformed the role of the state in international relations, was precipitated by the treaty.<br />3.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sentences is a good topic sentence?
        ANSWER: All of them.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think sentence 1 is too narrative and sentence 4 is much too narrow.
        ANSWER: 1, 2 and 3.
        FEEDBACK: I agree that sentences 2 and 3 make good topics.  I think sentence 1 is too narrative.  There's no argument offered, and a topic sentence should introduce a concept around which a discussion is based. 
        ANSWER: 2 and 3.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  These are sentences around which a discussion can be based.  Sentence 1 is too narrative and sentence 4 is too narrow.

INTRO  <font size="4">James tried six of the ministers. Conditions had soured so badly that by 1607 he remarked: <br /> &quot;This I must say for Scotland; here I sit and govern it with my pen. I write and it<br /> is done, and by a clerk of the Council I govern Scotland now, which others could <br /> not do by the sword.&quot;<sup>9</sup><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should the quotation be indented?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Well - not quite: this quotation is dead on 40 words, and so technically could be indented.  Click on blue question mark above the exercises for more information about this.  However, it looks better as part of the text.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: This quotation is dead on 40 words, so could be indented.  Click on blue question mark for more information.  However, at just 40 words,  it looks better incorporated into the text.
    QUESTION 1 If you indent text, do you need quotation marks?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Indented quotations do not require quotation marks:  the indent is enough.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect:  the indent is enough.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter:  academic referencing should be consistent, and it has been decided, for clarity, that an indented quote does not need quotation marks.
    QUESTION 2 Is the full stop after 'sword' in the right place?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This quotation is part of the bigger sentence that begins 'Conditions had'.  When a quotation is part of a bigger sentence, rather than being a sentence in itself, the full stop comes after the closing quotation mark and before the footnote number.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This sentence begins 'Conditions had'.  When a quotation is part of a bigger sentence, rather than being a sentence in itself, the full stop comes after the closing quotation mark and before the footnote number.

    QUESTION 0 There is one thing wrong with this sentence.  What is it?
        ANSWER: We don't need quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  This is a quotation, so we do need quotation marks.
        ANSWER: We don't need a colon.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  A colon quite properly introduces a quotation like this.
        ANSWER: The closing quotation mark should be placed before the full stop.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  This quotation comes within a sentence, so the closing quotation mark should be placed before the full stop.

INTRO  <font size="4">However, according to Michael Lynch:<br /><br /> <font size="2"> &quot;The document skilfully obscured the fact there were not one but numerous strands to the struggle, as well<br /> as different sets of competing principles: the issue of liberty was for most of the political nation tied up with<br /> feudal right and overlordship or, after 1306, the moral legitimacy of one King of Scots against another.&quot;<sup>1</sup><br /></font> <br />Another reason the Scots were fighting the English was the demand made by the English king, Edward 1, for military service in his army in France, &quot;It was the reluctance of the Scots to become involved in the English war effort which drove them into an alliance with France, which was agreed in October 1295. The contrast could hardly have been starker. England gave Scotland the status of a client state; France offered an alliance of two independent kingdoms guaranteeing each other military assistance and a future marriage between King John's son Edward and the niece of Philip IV.&quot;<sup>2</sup> <br /><sup><br /></sup></font><font size="4"></font><font size="4"> </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Should both quotations be indented, as the first one is?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  If you are going to include quotations of more than forty words, these should be set apart from the main text and indented (though not reduced in font size).  In this text, the writer has indented the first, but not the second, which adds inconsistency into the mix of errors.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  If you are going to include quotations of more than forty words, these should be set apart from the main text and indented (though not reduced in font size).  In this text, the writer has indented the first quotation but not the second, which adds inconsistency into the mix of errors.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Referencing style, which has been developed by your department for reasons of clarity and consistency, always matters.  It's part of academic discipline to keep to the style your department prefers.
    QUESTION 1 Should both quotations be in the same font size?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Both should be in the larger font size.  Quotations should never be in font size smaller than the main text.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotations should always be in the same font size, and that font size should be the same size as the main text.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  All academic departments have their own referencing style, for the sake of both consistency and clarity.  Students are expected to follow the style of their department.
    QUESTION 2 Is the first quotation in this text properly set out?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter, so long as it's clear that it is a quotation.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it always matters, and there is a reason for this:  clarity.  Referencing style has been refined over the years not to irritate, but to promote consistency.
    QUESTION 3 Should an indented quotation be enclosed in quotation marks?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Indented quotations do not need quotation marks.  Quotations set in the text need quotation marks, but single quotation marks, not double ones as the writer here has used.
        ANSWER: No.

    QUESTION 0 What is wrong with the formatting of this quotation?
        ANSWER: It should be enclosed in single quotation marks.  
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Quotations are always enclosed in single quotation marks.  Double quotation marks are reserved for quotations within quotations.
        ANSWER: The quotation should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Direct quotations are never italicised, even if from a foreign publication (or in a foreign language).
        ANSWER: It should be introduced with a colon.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  In this instance, the writer has used 'that'.  You do not need 'that' and a colon.
    QUESTION 1 Is the full stop in the right place?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Since the quotation is embedded into a wider sentence rather than being a complete sentence on its own, the full stop should come after the closing quotation mark.
        ANSWER: No. 
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Since the quotation is embedded into a wider sentence rather than being a complete sentence on its own, the full stop should come after the closing quotation mark.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter where the full stop is placed.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter.  Since the quotation is embedded into a wider sentence rather than being a complete sentence on its own, the full stop should come after the closing quotation mark.

    QUESTION 0 What is wrong with the quotation marks in this example?
        ANSWER: Nothing.  They are fine.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.
        ANSWER: They are double quotation marks when they should be single quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.
    QUESTION 1 When should you use double quotation marks?
        ANSWER: When the quotation is in a foreign language.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotations in a foreign language are still enclosed in single quotation marks.
        ANSWER: When a quotation is longer than 40 words or three lines.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  A quotation of over 40 words, or three lines, does not have quotation marks at all.  Instead, it should be separated from the main text by a line space and indented. 
        ANSWER: When the quotation is a quote within a quote.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  If you are quoting somebody, and they have quoted somebody else within the quotation you are using, that's the place for double quotation marks.  Click on the blue question mark above Quotation Marks, or the blue question mark above these exercises for further information and examples.
    QUESTION 2 Is the footnote number correctly placed?
        ANSWER: No.  It should come after the full stop following 'Norwich'.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.
        ANSWER: Yes.  It should be as near to the closing quotation mark as possible.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  When a quotation comes at the end of a sentence, the full stop should come after the closing punctuation - in this case the full stop after 'Norwich'.

    QUESTION 0 Is a comma the right way to introduce a quotation of this sort?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This quotation, since it is quite long and does not flow smoothly into the text, should be introduced by a colon.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This quotation, since it is quite long and does not flow smoothly into the text, should be introduced by a colon.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of personal choice.
        FEEDBACK: Sorry - it's not.  This quotation, since it is quite long and does not flow smoothly into the text, should be introduced by a colon. This is not just a decision by some old grammatical pedant.  The colon offers a longer pause than the comma, thus providing the quote with the correct emphasis.
    QUESTION 1 Is the quotation styled correctly?
        ANSWER: Its style is fine.
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't right.  A quotation set into the text like this is enclosed in single quotation marks.  Double quotation marks are reserved for quotations within quotations. 
        ANSWER: There's something wrong with the quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  A quotation set into the text like this is enclosed in single quotation marks.  Double quotation marks are reserved for quotations within quotations. 
        ANSWER: The capital E of education should be lower case.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The capital E is fine, since that is how it appears in the quoted book.
    QUESTION 2 Is the footnote number properly placed?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  When the quotation finishes the sentence, the number should come after the final bit of punctuation:  in this case, the full stop.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  When the quotation finishes the sentence, the number should come after the final bit of punctuation:  in this case, the full stop.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter where the footnote number goes so long as the writer is consistent.
        FEEDBACK: Consistency is important, but the placing of this footnote number is Incorrect.  When the quotation finishes the sentence, the number should come after the final bit of punctuation:  in this case, the full stop.  Better to be consistently correct than consistently incorrect.
    QUESTION 3 Is the final full stop properly placed?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. Since the quotation is embedded within the sentence, i.e. it is not the whole sentence, the full stop should be placed after the final quotation mark (with the footnote number after the full stop).
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Since the quotation is embedded within the sentence, i.e. it is not the whole sentence, the full stop should be placed after the final quotation mark (with the footnote number after the full stop).

    QUESTION 0 What is wrong with the style of this quotation?
        ANSWER: Nothing.  The style is correct.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotations should be placed within single inverted commas.  The quotation within the quotation should be placed in double inverted commas. 
        ANSWER: The quotation should be within single quotation marks and the quotation within the quotation within double quotation marks. 
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  That's the right style.
        ANSWER: It doesn't really matter how the quotation is styled.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Academic departments all subscribe to a style, not to be irritating and difficult, but for the sake of consistency, which is important both at university and in the world of work.
    QUESTION 1 There is something else the matter with this quotation.  What is it?
        ANSWER: There should be a colon after 'James'.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This quotation is nicely set within the flow of the text.  No colon is needed.
        ANSWER: The quotation should be set in italics.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Quotations should never be set in italics, unless they were in italics in the original text, in which case this would be indicated by inserting [sic], which shows that the italics are the original author's.
        ANSWER: The quotation should be on a new line and indented.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The quotation is nicely embedded into the text, and that's where it should remain.
        ANSWER: The full stop should come after the final quotation mark.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  This quotation is embedded into a sentence: it does not constitute a whole sentence in itself.  The full stop, which signifies the end of the sentence, should come after the final quotation mark.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis of Chopin's Prelude in C major, Op.29 No. 1<br /><br /></font><font size="4">This prelude was composed in 1839 as part of a set of preludes in each of the 24 keys of the piano. Dedicated to Joseph Kessler, although commissioned by piano-maker Camille Pleyel, the preludes are each self-contained and their brevity caused critics to question their worth when they were first published.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Is the</font> <font size="4">following text indiscriminate description or analysis/critical observation?</font> 
        ANSWER: It's analysis because it tells us important things about the preludes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is description.   However, it's not indiscriminate.  It's a perfectly good start to the essay provided analysis soon follows.  The next paragraph might read:   Prelude No. 1 consists of one repeated pattern that persists through the three formal sections.  Diatonic harmony dominates the eight bar opening section, etc. 
        ANSWER: It's indiscriminate description, not analysis or critical observation.

INTRO <span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis: Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2. in B flat major, Op. 83</span><br /><br />The Allegretto grazioso comprises a seven part rondo, A-B-A-C-A-B-A, the form allowing the movement enough length to balance the three previous movements of a concerto ironically dubbed by Brahms 'a tiny little piano concerto with a wisp of a scherzo' (Heninger 2005). <br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Is the following text description or analysis/critical observation?</font> 
        ANSWER: This is analysis.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  There is a general comment about the concerto but this seems in keeping, since although the analysis is of the fourth movement, the writer should show some knowledge of the other three.  The writer has also made sure to include important technical information right at the start.

INTRO <font size="4">The opening track of the album begins with a synthesized 'fuzz' noise which begins to crescendo. A melody played on piano then begins, and very subtle synthesized electronic 'blips' can be heard. After this, a distortion sound begins to crescendo into the piece and becomes clearer and louder. Next from 1.42 [minutes.seconds] we begin to hear a faint bass drum which plays on the first beat of every bar; this too crescendos becoming increasingly louder and clearer. The synth belectronic 'blips' become clearer, leading up to 2.10 at which a high-pitched synthesized 'fuzz' noise also begins to play the melody..</font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Is the following paragraph indiscriminate description or analysis/critical observation?</font> 
        ANSWER: This is analysis/critical observation.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is a very general, blow-by-blow account.  From this description, it would be impossible even to figure out what piece or genre the writer was describing, let alone get any deeper insight.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-style: italic;">Concerto for Cootie</span> is a prime example of Ellington's striving for the prestige of European classical music without abandoning his roots in African-American musical traditions. The haunting, chromatic line, actually written by the dedicatee, his then trumpeter, Cootie Williams, functions more like a theme than a straightforward 'tune'. The classical reference in the title is also more than bluster in that the piece artfully blends the verse-chorus scheme characteristic of popular music with the concerto form reminiscent of Viennese classicism. Note, too, how the ubiquitous call-and-response patterns, clear reminders of a Black heritage, are transformed into the exchange between soloist and ensemble so typical of the classical concerto. In these ways, the piece doesn't so much contrast or blend African-American, popular and European, classical traditions as find common ground between them.</font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Is this paragraph indiscriminate description or analysis/critical observation?</font> 
        ANSWER: This is description.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The bits of description are used to analyse. For example the descriptive 'haunting, chromatic line' is closely followed by 'functions more like a theme', which analyses the chromatic line's place in the work.  We also have good examples of critical observation, for example the last sentence about the common ground the piece finds between different types and styles of music.
        ANSWER: This is analysis and critical observation.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  There is description, but it's used to analyse. For example the descriptive 'haunting, chromatic line' is closely followed by 'functions more like a theme', which analyses the chromatic line's place in the work.

INTRO <font size="4">The second theme is developed and is a calmer and more tranquil part of the music. The theme weaves in and out through all the harmonic progress and the orchestration is rather less heavy, especially from G onwards.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Is this indiscriminate description or analysis/critical observation?</font> 
        ANSWER: This is indiscriminate description.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is very vague, with no precise details where we really need them.  For example, what kind of 'harmonic progress'? What does 'less heavy orchestration' mean? The isolated mention of a key centre provides no useful account of harmonic structure.  We've no idea how we ended up there.

INTRO  <font size="4">Assignment title:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aspects of Modernity: Discuss different accounts of the form of Debussy's </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Jeux.</span><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the assignment title, then choose the best introductory lines from the options provided. Each option has an explanation as to why it's good or poor, so even if you hit the right one straight away, it might be worth scanning through the others.</font> 
        ANSWER: Jeux, or 'Games', is the 'last work for orchestra written by Debussy' (Wikipedia 2011).  It was written in 1912 for the Ballets Russes and choreographed by Nijinsky.
        FEEDBACK: Although it's often useful to start with a quotation, Wikipedia is an unreliable source and does not demonstrate much effort on the writer's part.  In addition, the facts are baldly presented with no attempt to analyse why they might be relevant to the question.  These lines are not the best option here.
        ANSWER: Debussy's Jeux, or 'Games', has defied one defining account.  This is unsurprising since it was written when the development of musical modernism, for example the move away from tonality, affected all forms of artistic creation.  The two accounts of Jeux chosen for analysis in this essay highlight two different aspects:  the first focuses on the rhythmic organisation; and the second, the idea of unity through the use of cyclical form.
        FEEDBACK: These lines show proper engagement with the piece.  Although the year of composition is not stated, there is far better analysis of the context, and by the end, the reader knows just where the essay is going.  These are the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Debussy's Jeux was written for the Ballets Russes, with the scene set in a garden at dusk.  The main protagonists are two girls and a boy, who search for a tennis ball.  Flirting, jealousy, sulking and making up are the themes until a note of alarm is created by the arrival of another tennis ball, thrown in by an unseen hand.  This was the material with which Debussy worked.
        FEEDBACK: These lines simply tell the story without offering any insights or analysis.  Just telling the reader what happens is not acceptable in an academic essay that claims to be discussing form.

INTRO <font size="4">Assignment title:</font><br /><br /><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Are the facts of composers' lives of relevance to their music?</span></font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the assignment title, then choose the best introductory lines from the options provided. Each option has an explanation as to why it's good or poor, so even if you hit the right one straight away, it might be worth scanning through the others.</font> 
        ANSWER: When looking at a composer's life, there are two main aspects: their music and their ordinary life.  I will discuss whether or not, for most composers, the facts of their lives are of relevance to their music.  I will look at two famous composers, Haydn and Mozart, and examine how their lives affected their music. 
        FEEDBACK: These introductory lines add nothing to the discussion apart from indicating the two composers chosen for analysis.  Just repeating the terms of the question doesn't make a good introduction.  Although it's not wrong to use the active voice - I - take care that the essay doesn't sound childish.  Definitely not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Information about composers' lives is easy to come by, but how their lives affected their music is still difficult to tell.  It would be hard to tell for anybody's life, but it's particularly hard with creative people since the tendency is to look for links where none may exist.  Nevertheless, it is worth asking whether the facts of a composer's life can be related to their music and this essay will attempt to do just that.
        FEEDBACK: This introduction doesn't start too badly, although the first sentence is very general.  However, the lines then wander along, adding nothing to the discussion.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: Although many critics mine composers' lives as a means of understanding their art, for example Kavanaugh on the spiritual lives of the great composers (1996), it is, perhaps, more fruitful to mine composer's works to help understand their lives.  This essay will argue that this is particularly true of Robert Schumann, in whose Kreisleriana it is possible to glimpse future mental breakdown, and also in the much less wellknown work of his wife, Clara, whose 'profound ideas', according to her husband, were often lost because of the strains of running a household (Rattalino 2002).
        FEEDBACK: This is a novel way to start - by inverting the question.  It could go horribly wrong, but the examples and quotation show thought and engagement with the question.  These lines would make a marker want to read on.  These are the best option on offer here.

INTRO  <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Assignment title:<br /><br />What was Claude Debussy's particular contribution to musical development?</font><br /><br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the assignment title, then choose the best introductory lines from the options provided. Each option has an explanation as to why it's good or poor, so even if you hit the right one straight away, it might be worth scanning through the others.</font> 
        ANSWER: According to Hurd, Claude Debussy 'brought about a revolution', yet neither formulated a 'special theory' nor left behind dedicated disciples 1968:97).  This essay will argue that this is where Debussy's genius lies: that, at a time when other composers, for example Schoenberg, were consciously reacting against traditional forms and tonality, Debussy was instinctively discovering harmonic methods of his own, not as a reaction, but as a progression.  This essay will analyse Debussy's contribution to music through two works:  his Nocturnes, composed in 1895, and Images pour orchestre, composed in 1909.
        FEEDBACK: These lines show engagement with the question and a clear line of argument.  They are the best option here.
        ANSWER: Debussy 'brought about a revolution', and we can see this through all his works.  Living and working in Paris, the cultural capital of the nineteenth century, he was at the centre of artistic activity, and not just in music.  Artists abounded, and new forms took hold: impressionism, post impressionism and symbolism, surrealism.
        FEEDBACK: These lines show some thought, but no analysis, no real examples - lists of 'isms' don't really count.  You need to acknowledge sources and relate any examples to the essay question.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: Heavily influenced by Baudelaire, and Verlaine amongst others, Claude Debussy was a true intellectual and also a counter-culturalist.  In 1909, it was reported that 'the Debussy cult is making many people who are really desperately bewildered affect to perceive beauties and wonderful meanings that have probably escaped the attention of the composer' (Langham Smith, p.149).
        FEEDBACK: These sentences are non-sequiturs, i.e. they don't form a logical progression.  We also need evidence of Debussy's influences, and of his being a 'counter-culturalist' - if that really is a good description.  The quotation seems out of place because it is not really backing up the previous assertion.   In addition, there is no date in the reference.  Not the best option here.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Assignment title:</font><br /><br /><font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">What do you understand by the term 'folk music', and what is its value?</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the assignment title, then choose the best introductory lines from the options provided. Each option has an explanation as to why it's good or poor, so even if you hit the right one straight away, it might be worth scanning through the others.</font> 
        ANSWER: 'Folk music' is 'music that originates in traditional popular culture or that is written in such a style.  Folk music is typically of unknown authorship and is transmitted orally from generation to generation' (Oxford online dictionary).  It is important because it is music made by the people for the people.
        FEEDBACK: These introductory lines do not inspire confidence.  It's not really enough simply to copy and paste, even if you do acknowledge your source.  Quotations should add weight to, rather than be a substitute for, a thought of your own.  In addition, the Oxford Online Dictionary is not a specialist source.  Definitions of terms should always come from the Grove: http://www.grovemusic.com. Not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Folk music is the kind of music you hear on the street or in bars.  It is music made by ordinary people without musical training.  It often comes down to us through being played or sung at certain types of work.
        FEEDBACK: All of this may be true, but generalisations like this won't do in an academic essay.  You must provide evidence and examples.  This is not the best option here.
        ANSWER: The term 'folk music' is seldom defined twice in the same way.  For example, composers of the Romantic era thought of it as part of the 'national essence' (Middleton 1990:127); dictionaries add that it is usually transmitted orally (Oxford Online Dictionary 2011); and current exponents argue that it is 'pop music with a social conscience' (Ruehl n.d.).  These three definitions offer three routes into assessing its value: through classical composers heavily influenced by the 'national essence', for example Smetana; through English folk songs, for example 'Summer is a'cummin in'; and through the music of activists such as Bob Dylan.
        FEEDBACK: These introductory lines use quotations to back up a point:  that folk music is seldom defined by two people in the same way.  An essay plan is presented, with examples to be followed up.  The only criticism I'd make is that the Oxford Online Dictionary is not a specialist source.  Definitions of terms should always come from the Grove: http://www.grovemusic.com. Nevertheless, these lines are the best option here.

        ANSWER: Theodor W. Adorno lived from 1903 to 1969, and was a sociologist, philosopher and musicologist.  He wanted to be a composer, but it is has a theorist and critic that he is best known.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is not wrong, but it does not grab the attention.  Even in your first line, always try to find something more to say than bare facts.
        ANSWER: T. W. Adorno's polemic against popular culture is superficially attractive, particularly in the early 21st century when popular culture is dominated by generic and emotionally manipulative shows, for example The X Factor.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence shows engagement with the question.  Adorno's theory is 'superficially' attractive, which leads the reader to anticipate, with some interest, an argument against it.  An example is put to good use. This is the best option on offer.
        ANSWER: T. W. Adorno's polemic against popular culture has always been controversial.  This essay will discuss why it is controversial and try to discover whether the polemic was warranted or not.
        FEEDBACK: These lines simply repeat the question, adding nothing.  If they were deleted from an essay, they would not be missed.  Not the best option here.

        ANSWER: Popular groups often churn out the same style of song over their whole span of recording life.  But if they change, is this the beginning of the end?  This essay will try to discover.
        FEEDBACK: These lines provide one generalisation, no evidence and no essay map.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: With their seventh studio album, Revolver, the Beatles broke new ground both through the lyrics, for example the mournful 'Eleanor Rigby' and the musical arrangements, for example the use of a string octet.  The album shot to the top of the charts both in Britain and the US.  On 17th May 1966, Bob Dylan exchanged his acoustic guitar for an electric guitar and was famously derided as 'Judas'.

        ANSWER: The two analyses of Debussy's Jeux chosen for discussion inform our understanding of Jeux in different way: Berman's through the prism of another Debussy work; and Pasler through time and form.   Both accounts add to our understanding; both, as has been shown, open up new questions.  All the secrets of Jeux have not yet been uncovered.
        FEEDBACK: These lines draw together the strands of the essay together and also leave room for further discussion.  These are the best option here.
        ANSWER: To conclude, I think Paslar's account of Jeux is the best and the one Debussy would have agreed with.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is stark, and the assignment asks for discussion, so there's no need to plump for one account over another.  It's also dangerous to declare what Debussy would have thought unless you have evidence to back up your assertion.  This conclusion is not the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: To conclude, it should be noted that there are many more accounts of Debussy's Jeux than I have had space for here, some equally important.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion seems to undermine the whole essay.  The conclusion is not the place to mention the limits of the essay.  If this needs to be done, it should be done in the introduction.  The reader needs to feel he or she has come to a satisfactory end, not a dead end.

        ANSWER: To conclude, when the music does not match the facts, this could be because the facts are not complete.  Most of the time, in my opinion, the facts of a composer's life are relevant to their music.
        FEEDBACK: These concluding lines seem very brisk and offer a superficial analysis, with no mention of any composer by name.  Not the best option here. 
        ANSWER: As has been shown, decades of scrutiny into the lives of Robert and Clara Schumann have thrown up much conjecture as to the relationship between their lives and their music, and it is true that conjecture is not fact.  However, through the Schumanns' own writings we have also seen how their lives and music were inextricably intertwined, so that if the question 'are the facts of your lives relevant to your music?' was put to them, the presumption must be that the answer would be 'yes'.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion draws the strands of the essay together and faces squarely the inevitable objection that conjecture is not fact.  By using evidence, however, a convincing argument is made.  This conclusion is the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Thus we can see that in some cases the facts of a composer's life are of relevance to their music and in some cases not.  This is because composers are human beings first and composers second, so it is impossible for the facts of their lives not to influence their music.
        FEEDBACK: This is a rather superficial point, and does not seem to draw on any of the themes that must have made up the essay.  Not a good option.

        ANSWER: Thus, folk music can be defined as music handed down through the generations and its value lies in this continuity with the past.
        FEEDBACK: This is not bad, it's just a little stark.  Remember that your conclusion is the last thing your marker will read, so last impressions are important.  This isn't the best option here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, folk music defies definition and its value is that it allows ordinary people to express themselves in whatever way they like.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is too general, and seems to give up on the essay question.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, folk music defies definition only if the definition is too narrow.  It is, in essence, music made in the street and field rather than in the drawing room or concert hall and its value lies in its being 'a faithful reflection of ourselves' (Parry in Middleton 1990:131).

        ANSWER: Thus we can see that when popular groups or singers change their style, whether or not that's the beginning of the end depends on them being able to take their fans with them or losing them altogether.
        FEEDBACK: This option is hedges its bets and shies away from answering the question.  Not the best option on offer.
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, when popular groups or singers change their style, there is always the risk that they will lose their fans and that would mark the beginning of the end.  However, many groups manage the change and go on to forge even more successful careers.
        FEEDBACK: This option is a little plodding.  Your concluding lines are the last lines your marker will read, so it's worth trying to make them more memorable.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, a change of style is always risky:  the Beatles managed it;  Bob Dylan did not - or at least not at first.  This last point is crucial.  The end of a style is just that: the end of a style.  As Dylan showed, a new style can bring in new fans, so whilst there is certainly an end, it may be an ending that, in time, heralds a new beginning.

        ANSWER: Debussy's contribution to musical development was that he approached music in a new way and wrote many new works that are still highly popular today.
        FEEDBACK: This option is too bland.  It shows little engagement with the question and could have been written with no research at all.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: With his interest in the pentatonic and whole-note scales, Debussy opened contemporary listeners' ears to sounds beyond classical harmony based on the diatonic scale and orthodox chord sequences. He was not alone in introducing new harmonies, but his 'delicate washes of sound' (Hurd 1968:98) are unmistakeable and his contribution to musical development was to free others, for example Stravinsky, to push the boundaries of rhythm and tonality even further than he went himself. 
        FEEDBACK: This ending has not forgotten to include examples and to employ musical terms.  It's the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: With his interest in new colours and musical textures, Debussy opened contemporary listeners' ears to sounds with which they were not familiar.  He was not alone in introducing new harmonies but his particular contribution to musical development was to push the boundaries of what was acceptable and so pave the way for others to go further than he wished to go himself.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion has forgotten that even at the end you must remember to use appropriate technical terms and provide examples.  This is not the best option here.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the assignment title, then choose the best concluding lines from the options provided. Each option has an explanation as to why it's good or poor, so even if you hit the right one straight away, it might be worth scanning through the others.</font> 
        ANSWER: Thus we can see that Adorno's polemic against popular music was not warranted because it was informed too heavily by the times in which he lived.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is not wrong but it could be better fleshed out.  Not the best option here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, Adorno's polemic was informed by the times in which he lived, the 1930s, and his method of looking at things 'through the extremes' (Middleton 1990:35).  Both detract from the value of his polemic.  Nevertheless, his dissection of the function of music remains an important reminder of music's role in shaping society, something that without Adorno would be easier to ignore.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion doesn't forget the necessity of examples and quotations.  It's the best option here.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, Adorno's polemic was informed by his times and his methods.   As has been shown, however, his polemic remains valuable because he was an important contributor to debates about music which still persist today.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is very general, which never leaves a good impression.  Not the best option here.

<p>The concert hall was a place of congregation. Concert-goers dressed carefully and there was a general air of anticipation and excitement before a performance, even if the performance did not include a star performer. The introduction of sound recording in the late nineteenth century introduced a new medium for both the listener and the performer. No longer was listening to what might be called %u2018formal%u2019music %u2013 to differentiate it from street music %u2013 an exclusive experience. Over time, as the means of playing recorded music became cheaper, music became ubiquitous. </p>

    QUESTION 0 If you're analysing a work that's divided into movements, should each movement have a new paragraph?
        ANSWER: Yes.  New movements should always have new paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  If you're writing thematically, and take examples from different movements, there would be no need for a new paragraph every time you mentioned a new movement.
        ANSWER: No.  New paragraphs might not always be appropriate.

    QUESTION 1 If you find you have a whole unbroken page of text, should you divide it even if it's on one theme?

INTRO  The line of great German lieder writers continued after Schubert through Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Hugo Wolf. Wolf's contribution is particularly interesting on account of the use he made of Wagnerian techniques - the main burden of his songs falling to the piano, with the voice adding a realistic, dramatic recitative. French art-song, generally less dramatic than German and more inclined to sensitive lyricism, grew to greatness in the hands of Henri Duparc, Gabriel Faur? and Claude Debussy. Russia produced one outstanding song-writer in Modest Moussorgsky, whose songs are remarkable for their dramatic realism. Like Schubert, he explored unusual aspects of human nature, and found beauty in unlikely places.<br /><br /><font size="4"><font size="1">Adapted for teaching purposes from Michael Hurd's <span style="font-style: italic;">An Outline History of European Music</span>, 1968, Sevenoaks: Novello &amp; Company Ltd.</font></font><br />

INTRO  <font size="4">The Romantic movement, which began in English and German literature about the year 1770, found its musical voice during the early part of the nineteenth century. It remained a dominating force in music for nearly a hundred years. In very broad terms Romanticism is an attitude of mind that rejects the cool logic of the intellect and trusts instead in the instinctive truths of emotion. Thus, the Romantic movement represents a reaction against eighteenth century classicism - an Age of Unreason to counterbalance the Age of Reason.<br /><br /><font size="1">Adapted for teaching purposes from Michael Hurd's <span style="font-style: italic;">An Outline History of European Music</span>, 1968, Sevenoaks: Novello &amp; Company Ltd.</font> <br /></font>

        ANSWER: It's one paragraph about Romanticism.

        ANSWER: This text doesn't need dividing.  The unifying topic is Mozart.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  There are two topics here: Mozart's development of the ensemble; and Mozart's arias.  I think we need a new paragraph at 'So also in his arias ...'
        ANSWER: The text should be divided into two, the second paragraph staring with 'So also his arias ...'
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  There are two topics here: Mozart's development of the ensemble; and Mozart's arias.  We do need a new paragraph at 'So also in his arias ...'
        ANSWER: The text should be divided into three:  the second paragraph starting 'Mozart's dramas ...';  the third starting 'So also his arias ...'
        FEEDBACK: I agree that the text needs dividing, but I'd divide it into two, with the second paragraph beginning 'So also his arias'.  I think dividing it into three would make the paragraphs very short, and distract from the meaning of the text, rather than enhancing it.

        ANSWER: No.  The sentences are about the same composer and the same piece of music but the ideas need linking together.

INTRO <font size="4">After Beethoven lost his hearing, he was unhappy because he was unable to hear what they sounded like. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Does the second part of this question necessarily follow on from the first? 
        ANSWER: Yes.  If you can't hear, how can you hear what music sounds like?
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Think about it.  I'll bet you can hear music in your head even though there's nothing actually playing.  If you assert that Beethoven couldn't hear music even in his head, you'll need to provide proof.  In addition, 'they' has no reference.  Who are 'they'?
        ANSWER: No.  He might still have been able to hear music in his head.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  After all, even those of us with no musical genius can hear music in our heads.  If you're going to assert that Beethoven lacked this capacity, you'll need to provide evidence.But the broader problem is that Beethoven's deafness is a complex subject and the text gives a rather simplistic analysis.  In addition, 'they' has no reference.  Who are 'they'?

INTRO <font size="4">It may come as a surprise that the second subject in Beethoven's 'Waldstein' Sonata, Op. 53, is in E major.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Does this kind of statement help to illustrate the structure of the sonata in question?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It tell us about the key of the second subject, which is part of the sonata's structure.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The specification of the key of the second subject is meaningless without the key of the movement as a whole (C major).  In addition, an indication of the 'formal' framework (sonata form) and what would be expected (the dominant G major) would clarify the matter further.   So, here we might have:  Given that its outline is unequivocally in sonata form, it may come as a surprise that the second subject of the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C major, Op. 52, 'Waldstein', is in E major instead of the expected dominant, G major. 
        ANSWER: No.  You need to make an argument if you're going to claim something is a 'surprise' in the structure of a piece of music.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The specification of the key of the second subject is meaningless without the key of the movement as a whole (C major).  In addition, an indication of the 'formal' framework (sonata form) and what would be expected (the dominant G major) would clarify the matter further.

INTRO <font size="4">In the coda [of the first movement of Schubert%u2019s Trio Op. 100], the tune is first presented in the tonic Eb major, leading naturally to B minor.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Do the facts in this sentence lead logically on from one another.
        ANSWER: Yes.  We can see the harmonic progression through the listed keys, i.e. the tonic Eb major to B minor.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The phrase 'leading naturally' hides the fact that B minor is extremely remote from Eb major in conventional terms. We need an explanation.  So, we could have:  The coda of the first movement of Schubert's Trio Op. 100 features a prime example of what Richard Cohn (1999) calls a 'maximally smooth cycle', transforming harmonies by shifting voices by a semitone, one at a time. Moving around the 'western hemisphere' in clockwise direction (Eb major - Eb minor - B major/Cb major - B minor) this explains why the melody appears first in Eb major and then in the seemingly unrelated and enharmonically re-spelt B minor.  Here, the explanation, i.e. the 'maximally smooth cycle' with the intervening harmonies, supplies the context within which the coda's tune makes sense. N.B. listing isolated keys neither reveals anything nor demonstrates any understanding of the underlying harmonic process.
        ANSWER: No, there's something missing.

        ANSWER: Yes, these sentences create a clear line of argument, and the use of 'Baroque' and the phrases 'active' and 'static' make the value judgements valid.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Which sentence uses the musical terms and phrases correctly? </font> 
        ANSWER: 1. is incorrect.
        FEEDBACK: That's right. 1 is incorrect because 'syncopation' refers to the regular shifting of the accent, so a clave is not technically a syncopation. Likewise, a 'hemiola' concerns the ratio 3:2, in particular the switching between or combination of 6-8 and 3-4, so it is neither a syncopation, nor is a 'clave' a form of hemiola. A 'cross-rhythm', by contrast, refers to the regular shift of some beats in the bar (but not necessarily all, as in the syncopation), so this is the only term that can be applied to the clave. It has become quite common, though, to call any deviation from a metrical accent a 'syncopation' or sometimes 'rhythmic dissonance', but this should be avoided.
        ANSWER: 2. is incorrect.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  2 is actually correct because 'syncopation' refers to the regular shifting of the accent, so a clave is not technically a syncopation. Likewise, a 'hemiola' concerns the ratio 3:2, in particular the switching between or combination of 6-8 and 3-4, so it is neither a syncopation, nor is a 'clave' a form of hemiola.

    QUESTION 0 If you can only change one of the commas in this text into a full stop, which comma should be changed?
        ANSWER: The comma after 'education'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This could only be done by changing the text.  With the current text, 'oral and video education' is a sub-clause, so needs to be enclosed in commas. 
        ANSWER: The commas after 'intervention' in sentence 1.

    QUESTION 0 In sentence 1, one of the commas should be replaced by a colon.  Which one is it?
        ANSWER: The comma after 'time-line' should be a colon.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  'Time-line' is part of a list, and items in lists are not separated by colons.
        ANSWER: The comma after 'Leventhal'.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  'According to Leventhal' is a sub-clause (i.e. it adds something to the main clause (the main thought) of the sentence.  Here, it's correctly separated from the main clause with a comma.
        ANSWER: The comma after 'representation'.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  Colons introduce a list, and here is a clear example of a list.
    QUESTION 1 We need another colon in this text.  Where should it be?
        ANSWER: It should replace the full stop after 'components'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the full stop works well here.  This sentence is short and clear.
        ANSWER: It should replace the semi-colon after 'start'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The semi-colon can separate two whole sentences that are very closely linked (click the blue question mark above the tasks for examples).  Here, a colon would indicate that the second part of the sentence expands on the first part, so would add clarity and elegance.

If the pressure continues then the tissues become ischemic and eventually die, causing areas of damage to the skin (Waterlow, 2005). Shearing of the tissues,when combined with pressure, can also be responsible for causing pressure ulcers. Shear occurs when the person's body weight is combined with the already existing pressure, so that when the person tries to move part of their body, the skin remains fixed. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is this text fine as one paragraph?
        ANSWER: No.  It should be divided into two.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's fine as one paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think it should be divided into two.
    QUESTION 1 If you think it should be divided, where should the new paragraph start and why?
        ANSWER: The last sentence should be the start of a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again!
        ANSWER: 'Shearing of the tissues' should open a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Shearing is a new theme, and new themes should have paragraphs of their own.

    QUESTION 0 This text contains three themes.  Are they properly divided up into paragraphs?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Each theme needs a separate paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. Themes should be divided into paragraphs, but there's a difference between a theme and a list.  This is a list of risk factors.  To make a paragraph, each item on the list would need more information attached.
        ANSWER: No.  We don't need all these paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Themes should be divided into paragraphs, but there's a difference between a theme and a list.  This is a list of risk factors.  To make a paragraph, each item on the list would need more information attached.

INTRO <font size="4">A chest drain and attachment to an underwater seal system will have been selected as a mode of treatment in order to help restore the normal expansion and function of the lungs. This is done by removing air, blood, pus or fluid from the pleural space (Hyde et al. 1997, cited in Dougherty &amp; Lister 2008: 497). The nurse will be responsible for the maintenance of the chest drain. The main objectives of care are to keep the system patent, maintain sterility of the drainage system, infection control and to ensure the system remains upright and airtight (Kirkwood 2002, cited in Dougherty &amp; Lister, 2008). The nursing process is a four-staged system that allows the nurse to tailor care to each patient. It was formally incorporated into nurse training by the General Nursing Council in the UK in 1977 (Hogston &amp; Marjoram 2007). The four stages are assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Into how many paragraphs would you divide this text?
        ANSWER: Leave it at one.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again!
        ANSWER: Into two paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.
        ANSWER: Into three paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again!
        ANSWER: Into four paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 If you feel it needs dividing, where would your divisions come?
        ANSWER: The first division would come after the end of the first reference.  The second division would come before 'The four stages of assessment etc.'
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The first division would not be wrong, although some might deem it unnecessary.  The second division would be wrong because the text is now mid-theme.
        ANSWER: 'The nursing process ...' should start a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  There are two themes in this text:  the chest drain and nursing practice.  A new paragraph to indicate the start of nursing practice seems very much in order.

    QUESTION 0 In a dissertation, can each individual section comprise more than one paragraph?
        ANSWER: No.  A section should be one paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Paragraphs are dictated by theme not by section.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Paragraphs are dictated by themes, not by sections.
    QUESTION 1 Can a paragraph be any length?
        ANSWER: No.  A paragraph has to be more than five lines long.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  A paragraph can be any length, although a paragraph is normally more than one line or one sentence.  Be careful to make the distinction between a paragraph and a list.  Normally, a paragraph will be several lines long.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A paragraph can be any length, although a paragraph is normally more than one line or one sentence.  Be careful to make the distinction between a paragraph and a list.  Normally, a paragraph will be several lines long.
    QUESTION 2 If I have a big theme that takes up more than one page, should I subdivide that into paragraphs?
        ANSWER: No.  You must keep your theme together.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think a large block of text is unhelpful to the reader.  Normally, a big theme will break down into smaller ones. Look for these small breaks to make your paragraphs.
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's fine to chop up a theme into paragraphs.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think a large block of text is unhelpful to the reader.  Normally, a big theme will break down into smaller ones. Look for these small breaks to make your paragraphs.

    QUESTION 0 Does this text work as one paragraph?
        ANSWER: Yes.

        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It needs dividing up.
    QUESTION 1 If you think the paragraph needs dividing up, where would you divide it?
        ANSWER: After 'offer support'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think we're still in the middle of 'wound care and management'.
        ANSWER: After 'dignity maintained'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The word 'overall' starts a new theme, which is a broader look at the nurse's role.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sentences is the fragment?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  This sentence has no driving verb that tells us when the action has, is, will be or might be performed.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Sentence 2 has a main verb:  'is'.  This verb sets the action in time.
    QUESTION 1 How can you repair this fragment?
        ANSWER: By inserting 'this is a good opportunity' after 'also' in sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: You can certainly do it that way.  There's also another way.
        ANSWER: By removing the full stop at the end of sentence 2, adding the word 'and' and joining sentence 1 to the end of sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: That's also correct.  Well done.  If you do this, remember to remove the comma after 'also' so that the text flows smoothly.

    QUESTION 0 Which sentence is the fragment (i.e. contains no driving verb)?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  The driving verb in sentence 1 is 'suppresses'.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'Stimulating' is not a driving verb, i.e. it doesn't set the action in time.  We can put it right by simply running the two sentences together divided only by a comma:  Insulin suppresses glucose production in the liver, stimulating glucose uptake in muscles and fat.

INTRO 1. This worked.<br />2. Suggesting to the patient that since he lived near his work, walking to his office might help combat his weight problem.<br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Which is the sentence fragment (i.e. contains no driving verb), sentence 1 or sentence 2?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Sentence 1 has a subject - 'This' (a pronoun standing in for a noun or naming word), and a driving verb - 'worked'.  'Worked' sets the action (whatever the action is) in time.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  This has all the feel of a subclause because 'Suggesting' is not a driving verb, i.e. it does not set the action in time.  'Lived' is not the driving verb for this sentence either, since this is part of the subclause enclosed in commas and introduced by the word 'that'.

    QUESTION 0 Which is the sentence fragment, sentence 1 or sentence 2?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  We have a driving verb here 'can'.   This sets the sentence in time, since the conditional (might, could, can) is also a verb tense.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'Causing' is not a driving verb, i.e. it doesn't set the sentence in time.  We could solve the fragment problem by changing the verb into the present tense:   Redundancy causes depression.

        ANSWER: 'Referring to' is a driving verb.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  This type of verb doesn't set the action in time and a driving verb must set the action in time.
        ANSWER: 'Was referred to' is a driving verb.
        FEEDBACK: That's right:  this sets the action in time.  In this case, 'was' sets the action in the past.

        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  This sentence hangs in the air since we don't know what has to happen 'so that she achieves her goal weight'. 
        ANSWER: Sentence 2 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Sentence 1 is the fragment because the sentence hangs in the air, i.e. there's no driving verb so we don't know what 'she' must to do achieve her goal weight.
    QUESTION 1 How can we cure the fragment without rewriting both sentences?
        ANSWER: We can't.
        FEEDBACK: We can!
        ANSWER: By running the sentences together, with sentence 2 coming first.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  If we do that, we get a complete sentence, reading as follows:   This would help to guide Lily so that she achieves her goal weight.

    QUESTION 0 Is the indefinite article before 'nursing care' necessary?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's not correct.  'Good nursing care' is a concept so doesn't need an article.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  'Good nursing care' is a concept so doesn't need an article.
    QUESTION 1 Do we need an article before 'process of nursing'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  We're talking about a particular process - the process of nursing - so we need the definite article.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  We're talking about a particular process - the process of nursing - so we need the definite article.
    QUESTION 2 Do we need the definite article, as in 'the four main stages'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  The stages are being referred to as concepts, so we don't need an article here.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  The stages are being referred to as concepts, so we don't need an article here.
    QUESTION 3 Which of these stages are correct in their use of, of leaving out of, the article?
        ANSWER: 'The planning' and 'an implementation' are correct.

        ANSWER: 'An implementation' is right.  The others are wrong.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Try again.

        ANSWER: Yes, we need an indefinite article (a).
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  We're talking about a particular diagnosis, but use the indefinite article since diagnosis could be one of many until specifically named.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.   We need the indefinite article - a -  because a diagnosis could be one of many until specifically named.

        ANSWER: The question is too general.  The patient could go off at a tangent.
        FEEDBACK: This is true, but that might be a good thing because the patient might reveal information that would be useful.  
        ANSWER: The question encourages the patient to complain.

        ANSWER: Closed.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The patient can answer 'yes' or 'no' so this makes it a closed question.

        ANSWER: On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is the pain?
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It's easy for the patient to make a snap decision, particularly as it's not clear how bad 10 is supposed to be.
        ANSWER: Is the pain only in your leg?
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This question might encourage the patient to expand, but can still be answered 'yes' or 'no'.
        ANSWER: Pain can be very debilitating.  How is it affecting your everyday life?

    QUESTION 0 Should references within the text ever be in italics?
        ANSWER: Yes.  Book titles and journal titles are italicised.
        FEEDBACK: Well - you're right about the book titles and journal titles. However, citations within your text are of authors and publication dates only, so italics are never appropriate.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  Citations within your text are of authors and publication dates only, so italics are never appropriate.
    QUESTION 1 When you cite a reference at the end of a sentence within your text, should the full stop come before or after the final bracket of the reference?
        ANSWER: Before.  The reference is not part of the sentence.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  The reference is part of the sentence, so the full stop should come after the final bracket.
        ANSWER: After.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  The reference is part of the sentence, so the full stop should come after the final bracket.
    QUESTION 2 If you cite a website with no named author, what do you place in brackets in the text?
        ANSWER: The whole url line, including the date you accessed the site.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Put in the title of the article in brackets, or (website 1) and then list the websites appropriately in your references section.  Only put the date accessed in the references section, not in the text itself.
        ANSWER: The name of the article, and the date you accessed the site.

    QUESTION 0 Is this direct quote correctly inserted into the text?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It's in quotation marks, so we know it's a direct quote.
        FEEDBACK: It is in quotation marks, but that's not quite enough.
        ANSWER: No.  It stands out from the text rather than being incorporated into it.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  If you quote directly, the quoted text should, notwithstanding the quotation marks, be incorporated into the flow of your own text.  It should not stand out all on its own.
    QUESTION 1 Should the quotation marks be single or double?
        ANSWER: Quotation marks should be double. 
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Quotation marks should be single.  Double quotation marks are reserved for quotations within quotations, e.g. Levy argues that Simpson is 'mistaken when he says "women are more prone" '.  If you insert a quotation within a quotation, make sure you close both the double and the single quotation marks, even if it means placing the quotation marks one after the other.

        ANSWER: For the purposes of this assignment, the intention is to discuss then analyse a holistic assessment which was carried out on a patient with her consent.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This opening line is full of superfluous words.  What value do the phrases 'for the purposes of this assignment and 'the intention is' add?  Keep your opening lines crisp and to the point.  This is not a good choice.

        ANSWER: Acne is a multifactorial disease which involves hormonal, microbial and ommune mechanisms.
        FEEDBACK: This line would be fine, except that it's missing a reference.
        ANSWER: Acne is one of the most common complaints to afflict humanity.  Nearly all of us have suffered from it at one time or another, particularly at puberty.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too general and unsubstantiated for a strong opening.  Try not to generalise, even as a way into a section.
        ANSWER: 52% of acne patients and 44% of general practitioners consider acne a trivial condition (Polit 2004) but according to a study by Mallon, Newton, Klasen, Stewart, Ryan and  Finlay (1999), the psychological effects can be very great.

        FEEDBACK: This is a statement of the obvious.  A waste of words, so not a good choice.
        ANSWER: There are five dimensions in the Commonsense Model of Illness (Leventhal and Cameron 1980), namely: identity, perceived cause, timeline, consequences and curability/controllability.
        FEEDBACK: This is authoritative and informative and gets straight to the point.  This is the best choice of those on offer here.
        ANSWER: The Commonsense Model of Illness explored by Leventhal and Cameron (1980) is key to any discussion on psychology and sociology as applied to health.
        FEEDBACK: This line isn't wrong.  It gives us the name of a key study.  However, it's not the best opening line on offer here because it tails off after the key bit of information has been given.

        ANSWER: Obesity is the term used to describe excess body fat ad the usual measure of obesity in children is the body mass index (BMI) which is calculated by taking the child's weight in kilograms and dividing it by their height in metres squared.
        FEEDBACK: This is not the best choice.  Although it's good to define obesity, there is no mention in the title of children.  You may want to include children in your work, but you must explain why first.
        ANSWER: Type 2 diabetes develops in obese patients because obesity results in the patient's body becoming less sensitive to insulin released from the pancreas, thus leading to a rise in blood glucose levels.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good opening line, directly relevant to the title. The next line should define obesity.  The best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Type 2 diabetes, when poorly managed, can lead to many other problems including damage to blood vessels.
        FEEDBACK: This reads like a line from somewhere in the text, but not at the start.  The best opening lines address the whole subject, not part of the subject. This choice is not the best option here.

        ANSWER: Obesity is currently the most common metabolic disease encountered worldwide and its incidence and prevalence are continuing to rise rapidly (Caterson and Gill, 2002). 
        FEEDBACK: This is not a bad first line.  It defines obesity and is properly referenced. However, it is a little wordy - we don't need incidence and prevalence - and to be perfect, would say something authoritative and informative about the focus of the question, which is the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes 
        ANSWER: Quality of life is diminished for those who have diabetes related complications brought on by an existing condition, for example, obesity.
        FEEDBACK: What this opening line says may be true but it does not focus on the question asked.   Not the best option. 
        ANSWER: The relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes can be clearly illustrated through a study conducted in 2005 by Halpern and Mancini.  They found that not only do obesity and type 2 diabetes frequently occur together, but that 60-90% of all patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are, or have been, obese.

        ANSWER: Life is hard for people facing redundancy and studies have been done to see how redundancy affects their health.
        FEEDBACK: This opening is unfocused.  If it was deleted, the assignment would not suffer.  This is not the best option here.
        ANSWER: The Anticipation Effect as evidence by staff facing redundancy is the effect on their health experienced by those people anticipating redundancy from their work.
        FEEDBACK: Far too much repetition here.  We just have the terms of the question repeated in different ways, with almost nothing added.  Not a good option.

        ANSWER: Nurses are increasingly expected to adopt an evidence-based practice, which makes use of best clinical practice in making patient care decisions.
        FEEDBACK: This opening seems a little random, given the topic title.  It does speak about research, but it would punch harder if it was sharper or contained more information about what is to come.
        ANSWER: This critique will focus on two papers researching fluid and dietary compliance amongst patients undergoing haemodialysis:  one paper using a quantitive research design and the other a qualitative design.  
        FEEDBACK: This introduces the topic and shows why each paper was chosen (i.e. the general difference between them).  The next line should tell us what the studies are.  Of the choices on offer here, this is the best.
        ANSWER: This critique will focus on two selected research studies dealing with dietary and fluid compliance in patients undergoing haemodialysis.
        FEEDBACK: Using the terms of the question in your opening line is a good thing but just repeating it is a waste of words.  This is not a good option.

        ANSWER: Theme 2.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Clearly outlined here are four stages of nursing.  The next sentence should link these stages to the injury referred to in the assignment title.
        ANSWER: Theme 3.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence is about nursing priorities, so although nursing and patient management are clearly linked, you still need to keep your themes organised so that the reader can follow one theme before moving onto the next.
    QUESTION 1 There's something missing from the sentence.  What is it?
        ANSWER: A link to the injury outlined in the assignment title.

        ANSWER: A reference.

INTRO  <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Research module assignment title: </font><br /><br /><font size="4">Patients' experiences of attending a palliative daycare centre.</font><br /><br />Palliative daycare is the fastest growing but least researched area of palliative care (Myers &amp; Hearn, 2001). Common themes in research are patients feeling relaxed and comfortable in the daycare setting <style>@font-face { font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; }</style> but more research is needed to identify the particular qualities ofdaycare centres that produce these feelings. In a study of five palliative care day centres in the London region, two models were identified: social, and medical. The study involved interviewing new referrals to the 'social' daycare service three times over a three month period to assess if themes identified changed over time. The number of patients able to take part in the study did not remain stable.<br /> 
    QUESTION 0 How many themes does this paragraph address?
        ANSWER: One.  It's all about palliative daycare.
        FEEDBACK: That's the general heading, I agree.  But several themes emerge.
        ANSWER: Two.  Palliative daycare and a particular study.
        FEEDBACK: These themes are certainly incorporated, but it seems to me that the paragraph skips about, and more themes are addressed.
        ANSWER: Three.  Palliative daycare, the need for a study and the outcome of a particular study.
        FEEDBACK: These themes are incorporated, but I think the paragraph needs to be dissected further.
        ANSWER: Four.  Palliative daycare, the need for a study, a study model and the outcome of that study.
        FEEDBACK: These themes are incorporated, but yet further dissection is needed.
        ANSWER: Five.  This paragraph incorporates sentences from five different parts of a research module.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think each of these sentences addresses a different theme in a research module:  an introductory sentence; the focus of need for another study;  how the new study was designed;  the methodology; the results.

A research aim might be to assess what is important to patients attending a palliative daycare centre.  Research objectives might be: to elicit patients' reasons for attending a palliative daycare unit;  to establish what benefits the service provides in the eyes of a) the patient; and b) the staff;  to discover whether there are services patients feel that the daycare service should provide but currently does not.

        FEEDBACK: In a way, but how many should it need?  Try again.
        ANSWER: One.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, that's right.  Ideally, an abstract is one paragraph long.
        ANSWER: At least two.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Ideally, an abstract should be one paragraph long.
    QUESTION 1 Where, in your project or dissertation, should the abstract be placed?
        ANSWER: After the introduction.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Try again.
        ANSWER: After the title page.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.
        ANSWER: At the end of the dissertation.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Try again.
    QUESTION 2 Is the abstract the same as the introduction.

        FEEDBACK: That's a common misapprehension! Try again.
        ANSWER: No, they perform different functions.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  The abstract is an overview of your entire text.  The introduction sets the scene in some detail.
    QUESTION 3 What should a reader find in your abstract?
        ANSWER: Your personal reasons for choosing the topic.
        FEEDBACK: No - the personal should not be included in an academic text.
        ANSWER: A brief synopsis of the study, identifying the nature and scope of your work.
        FEEDBACK: Yes - this is very important.  Readers will read your abstract to see if it contains the kind of research they're looking for.
        ANSWER: A history of the topic.
        FEEDBACK: No - the abstract's not the place for a history of the topic. 
        ANSWER: The particular contribution your study makes to knowledge in the field.
        FEEDBACK: Yes - a reader will also expect to find this information in the abstract.
        ANSWER: The major outcomes.
        FEEDBACK: Yes - an abstract is not like a novel, where you want to keep the reader in suspense.  In an abstract for a nursing dissertation, you need to tell the reader what you found right at the start.

Research suggests that more than half of all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients experience delirium and will continue to do so after discharge to the ward, an half of those experiencing delirium in the ward will die within one year of delirium diagnosis.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these three sentences would be the best way of starting an abstract?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree, even though this is an excellent sentence - very clear and precise.  It's just that from the options offered, this isn't the sentence that does the most work.  Remember the purpose of the start of your abstract:  to give a brief synopsis of your study, identifying the nature and scope of your work.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Sentence 1 is clear and precise, but sentence 2 offers more information about the literature review itself, and is therefore a better choice for the opening of the abstract.
        ANSWER: Sentence 3.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Remember the purpose of the start of your abstract:  to give a brief synopsis of your study, identifying the nature and scope of your work.

INTRO <font size="4">Can you answer the following question(s)?</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the introduction the same as an abstract, only a little longer?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid that's not right.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  An abstract and an introduction have two different functions.  An abstract is an overview of your entire dissertation or project.  An introduction sets the scene for your topic in detail.
    QUESTION 1 How long should the introduction be?
        ANSWER: One paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: It might be, but that would be unusual.  An introduction might be over a page long - long enough to perform all its functions.
        ANSWER: Two paragraphs at most.
        FEEDBACK: It might be two paragraphs, but not two AT MOST since an introduction must be long enough to perform all its functions.
        ANSWER: As long as it needs to be.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  An introduction might be over a page long.  The important thing is that it performs all its functions.
    QUESTION 2 From the following, pick out the three functions of an introduction.
        ANSWER: To set the scene for the dissertation or project.
        FEEDBACK: Well done.  That's one function.  
        ANSWER: To say why the topic appeals to you personally.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not a function of an introduction to an academic text.
        ANSWER: To give a complete history of the topic.
        FEEDBACK: No, not a complete history.  You need to place your particular dissertation or project in context and this may involve some history, but don't go back to the year dot.
        ANSWER: To explain why the topic is worth investigating.
        FEEDBACK: Yes.  This is a very important aspect of your introduction.
        ANSWER: To describe in detail any literature you're going to critique.

        ANSWER: This report contains details of an experiment measuring the effect of increasing temperature on capacitors with different dielectrics.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence simply repeats the title of the experiment, adding nothing.  The opening line of an abstract needs to engage the reader.  Not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: Capacitors have many applications in the electronics industry, and the dependence of capacitance and impedance of temperature on commercial capacitors needed further exploration.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good opening for an abstract.  It provides the rationale for the experiment, one of the abstract's primary functions.  This is the best option here.
        ANSWER: Capacitors have been around since 1745, when Ewald Georg von Kleist discovered a way to store an electric charge.

        ANSWER: Given the known hazards in terms of hazard to both human health and the environment, the risk/benefit analysis of nuclear waste needs constant review.  
        FEEDBACK: I'd say this was a good opening.  It provides a good rationale for the review.  The next sentence should outline the scope of this particular review. 
        ANSWER: The calamities at Chernobyl and Fukushima were really dreadful and the nuclear industry is under a lot of pressure.  
        FEEDBACK: An opening sets the tone, and the tone here is too chatty, e.g. 'really dreadful' and 'a lot of'. Not the best option of those offered.

All the options have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it might be worth having a look at all the comments. </font> 
        ANSWER: Billions of years ago, nature, in its infinite wisdom, managed nuclear fusion in the stars and now nuclear fusion is seen as the ultimate goal of physicists.  
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is ruined by cliche, i.e. 'in its infinite wisdom', and sweeping generalisation.  Is fusion really the ultimate goal of ALL physicists?  I doubt it.  Your abstract needs to catch the reader's interest, but through its academic worth, not through hyped-up language.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Claims made for nuclear fusion, a potential source of clean, efficient and cheap energy, are many and often contradictory.
        FEEDBACK: I like this opening of the abstract.  It states the rationale (i.e. claims are often contradictory, which means they need analysing) and wastes no words.  This is the best of the options here.

        ANSWER: 'One might wish to be able to calculate N-body observables for particles with large scattering lengths from first principles' (1).
        FEEDBACK: The tone of this sentence - one might wish, etc. -  reveals that the reader is already expected to be engaged in the report, so this is not the start of the abstract: rather, it's the start of the section entitled 'Scattering models'.
        ANSWER: 'A classic example of a system with a large scattering length is 4He atoms, whose scattering length is more than a factor of 10 larger than the range of the interaction' (1).
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is detailed, which indicates that it comes from further into the report than the abstract.  In fact, in comes from the introduction.
        ANSWER: 'Particles with short-range interactions and a large scattering length have universal low-energy properties that do not depend on the details of their structure or their interactions at short distances' (1).
        FEEDBACK: Yes, this is the first sentence of the abstract.  It defines the context of the report.

        ANSWER: Sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This sentence looks like part of the method section.  It contains nothing relevant to the conclusion.  The summary and conclusion section needs to focus on what was learned from the experiment, not the aims or mechanics of the experiment. 
        ANSWER: Sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This contains information more suited to the method section.  The summary and conclusion section needs to focus on what was learned from the experiment, not the aims or mechanics of the experiment. 
        ANSWER: Neither sentence.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. Sentence 1 probably belongs in the aims section, and sentence 2 in the method section.  The summary and conclusion section needs to focus on what was learned from the experiment, not the aims or mechanics of the experiment.

        ANSWER: 1. is a complete sentence and 2 is a fragment.

        ANSWER: 1. is a sentence fragment and 2. is a complete sentence.
        FEEDBACK: That's right. In sentence 1.,  'evaluating' and 'coming up with' are not main verbs: they don't set the sentence in time.  In sentence 2., the verb phrases 'cannot be evaluated' and 'need to be' set the sentence in time, i.e. the present, so sentence 2. is a complete sentence.

    QUESTION 0 Are the semi-colon and colon used properly in this text?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Colons introduce a list, such as this list of apparatus, so we need a colon instead of a semi-colon here.  A semi-colon separates items in a list (although commas will often do just as well) or separates two complete sentences that are closely related.  A semi-colon would be better in the second sentence here.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sentences is incorrectly punctuated: 1, 2 or 3.
        ANSWER: 1. is incorrectly punctuated.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A colon can also stand in for the phrase 'that is' or 'for example', with the second part of the sentence expanding on the first.  A colon seems appropriate here, although other forms of punctuation also work.
        ANSWER: 2. is incorrectly punctuated. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A semi-colon can be used to divide two sentences that are closely connected, so a semi-colon works well here.  It's not the only form of punctuation that works well, though, so you might like to look at the other choices.
        ANSWER: 3. is incorrectly punctuated.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A comma doesn't work well here.  We need a slightly harder pause.  A colon or a semi-colon works better.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.  e.g. The values for thermal conductivity of metals are high in comparison to other elements.  This is because of the ability of the electrons to move around.  Glass and the insulation used have a low value of k, however, which is why they are used to stop heat loss in the experiment.

        FEEDBACK: Not 'because of'.  Try again.

        ANSWER: There should be a full stop after 'Litvinenko', another after 'stomach'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree with the full stop after Litvinenko, but a full stop after 'stomach' leaves the rest of the text - 'and ultimately killed him from the inside out' - as a sentence fragment, i.e. a sentence with no driving verb.  See 07. Sentence fragments.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.   It should be two sentences, with the second sentence beginning 'For environmental reasons'.  If there's also a full stop after 'waste', we create a sentence fragment, i.e. 'The simplest being landfill and ocean dumping of the waste sealed into drums'.  This is not a complete sentence as it contains no driving verb. (See section 07. of this website.)

    QUESTION 0 Which sentence should be divided into two sentences?
        ANSWER: 1. should be divided into two sentences, with the full stop coming after 'physics'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  If you put a full stop after 'physics' you create a sentence fragment, i.e. 'all using objective data and quantitative methods'.  This phrase does not contain a main verb (see section 07. of this website).
        ANSWER: 2. should be divided into two sentences, with the full stop coming after 'physics'.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  In sentence 2 we have two main subjects and verbs: 'The natural sciences' (subject) 'comprise' (main verb);  and 'all' (subject) 'use' (main verb).  This sentence, because it has two main subjects and verbs, should be divided into two complete sentences.   In contrast, if we divide sentence 1 into two, putting the full stop after 'physics', we end up with one complete sentence and one sentence fragment (see section 07. of this website).

In this case, a new topic has been introduced.  Topic 1 is the effects of Fascism.  Topic 2 concerns historians.  I think these sentences would be better separated by a full stop.

        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The second part of  sentence 2 gives specific illustrations of what has been asserted in the first part of the sentence.  In contrast, the second part of sentence 1 is closely linked to the first part, but makes a more general point.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The second part of  sentence 2 gives specific illustrations of what has been asserted in the first part of the sentence.  In contrast, the second part of sentence 1 is closely linked to the first part, but makes a more general point.

        ANSWER: 1.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism and creationism fundamentally reject the modern world, and this rejection in itself describes one major problem of the modern world:  a sense of alienation.  This sense is witnessed by ...
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines fulfil one of the major criteria of a good opening line:  they grab the author's attention.  I like the fact that we're also to get an example early on.  A powerful opening and the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Modern society has many problems and the literature on fundamentalism and creationism tells us a great deal about those problems.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the question.  It tells us nothing.  Nor does it open the essay up.  We wouldn't miss this line if it was removed from the essay.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism is 'strict adherence to a specific set of theological doctrines typically in reaction against the theology of Modernism' (Wikipedia 2011).
        FEEDBACK: Although beginning your essay with a defining quotation is a good technique, wikipedia is not a reliable source of information.  For this reason, this is a poor choice.

    QUESTION 0 This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        ANSWER: This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the terms of the question.  Nothing is added and it does not open up the essay in any way.  If you removed this line, the essay would be none the poorer.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Marx and Engels both saw communism as a logical step in societal evolution but if communism was the next step forward from industrial capitalism, then Russia would not have been either Marx or Engels' choice for the experiment.  As they ask in the preface to the 1882 edition of the Communist Manifesto ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines are informative but opening lines need to seize the essay question directly.  All this information may be useful within the essay, but as opening lines these are unhelpful.
        ANSWER: The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1921 as a direct result of a collapse in production following an international war and a internal revolution.  The reasons for its abandonment are more complex, but an analysis of these reasons shows not just why the NEP lasted only seven years, but also how its own structure meant that failure in the long term was inevitable.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines address the question directly.  They add information and they open up the question in an interesting way.  These lines are the best choice.

        ANSWER: Throughout the ages, women have been seen as the 'weaker' sex.  In ancient Greece, for example, long hailed as an example of democracy, women were not seen as equal to men.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines are much too general.  They might do for an article in a tabloid newspaper but simply waste words in an academic essay.  In an academic essay, you need to seize the subject from the very start. Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: That any public policy in 21st century should have to address specifically the needs of women shows that public policy directed at women's equality has been ineffective.  However, this may be more to do with women's expectations than public policy failure.  For example, ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines certainly grab the reader's attention.  Confident and controversial, they would make any reader want to read on.  The best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Women have a pretty rough ride as I know from experience.  In 2010, my mother is still not being paid the same as her male counterparts.  Public policy is pretty ineffective if it cannot even guarantee the same wage for the same job.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too anecdotal and colloquial.   With a few tweaks - for example using the experience of the writer's mother in a more objective way, with hard evidence attached - they could be transformed into lines suitable for an academic essay.  As they stand, however, these lines are not the best choice here.

        ANSWER: Urbanisation, attitudes towards health, poor diet, poor housing and environmental degradation were all challenges to public health in the 19th century.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line gets straight to the point.  The best option here.
        ANSWER: During the 19th century, many things changed in Britain and across the whole of Europe.  
        FEEDBACK: This sentence adds nothing to the essay, simply repeating the terms of the question.  We wouldn't miss this opening line if it were deleted.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Throughout history, nations have faced challenges in public health, but it is only within the last three hundred years that public health has become an issue of real concern.  In 14th century, for example, people were certainly worried about catching the plague and some containment policies were put in place.  However,  you could hardly call this a start to overcoming public health challenges.
        FEEDBACK: These lines tell us something, but they don't get straight into the question.  In an academic essay in Social and Political Science, you should not waste time on a potted history unless it's a necessary part of the answer to the essay question.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Essay question:<br /><br /></font>How, in some European societies, did World War I create favourable preconditions for the emergence of Fascist parties?<br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: There is a general consensus amongst those who study World War 1 that it left a lasting impact on world politics.  It was, after all, the Great War; the War to End All Wars.  Ten million men lost their lives and it is generally agreed that the world was never the same again.
        FEEDBACK: These lines start well, but the second line begins to drift.  Make sure you stick firmly to the question in your opening lines.  First impressions are very important.
        ANSWER: Three conditions are necessary for the emergence of fascism: nationalist ideology; a charismatic leader and a political environment which provides democratic legitimacy.  By looking closely at the legacy of World War I, it is possible to identify certain preconditions which gave birth to these conditions, and this essay will explore these preconditions with particular reference to Germany and Spain.
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear and confident start.  The reader learns something important from the first sentence, and the second sentence provides an essay map.   These lines are the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: World War I (1914-1918) was a conflict caused by a number of factors, but the immediate catalyst was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by a Serb.  This assassination set in motion a war of mass carnage, which dragged on until finally ending with Germany's humiliation at the Treaty of Versailles.
        FEEDBACK: Nothing here is wrong - except that by the end of these lines a reader who had not seen the question would have no idea what the essay was supposed to be about.  There is no mention of fascism.  Every fact in your first lines must be relevant to the essay question.  However well written they are, if your first lines are just a wander through history, they'll gain you no marks.

        ANSWER: It is clear, then, that one of fascism's most devious strengths is its principle of adapting and gathering   to itself other creeds, even ones seemingly inimical to its beliefs. Fascism is, therefore, not necessarily anti-Christian because it is not, by necessity, anti anything at all.
        FEEDBACK: These are strong closing lines that come to a thought-provoking conclusion.  These are the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Unfortunately, as this essay has proven, we do not as yet fully understand the relationship between fascism and Christianity.
        FEEDBACK: The statement made by these concluding lines may be true but the lines leave the reader with a sense of anti-climax.  The essay question asked for an answer.  If there is no answer, try not to finish your essay with a sentence beginning 'unfortunately', since this leaves a clear impression of defeat.  These lines are not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: In addition, we might remember that the term 'clerical-fascism' is an oxymoron, which leaves us with the question:  were these Catholic states fascist at all?

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: As has been seen, diversity of crops, a more prosperous economy and famine relief schemes were key to Scotland avoiding famine in the 1840s. In Ireland, failure to address any of these issues in time meant that famine was an inevitable result of potato blight.  When combined with the policies of the British government, mass starvation was unavoidable.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines briefly recapitulate the themes of the essay in order to give a satisfactory answer to the essay question. These are the best lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: There were also other causes of the famine, for example landlords mismanaging their lands, but these do not truly account for the differences in the effects of famine between Scotland and Ireland.
        FEEDBACK: These lines rather drift to a halt, and it is always a mistake to bring in new ideas right at the end of an essay.  If there are topics you cannot include for space reasons, but you want to make reference to them, the introduction is the right place to mention them, not the conclusion.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: It was a truly terrible time for the Irish and the British government should apologise and hang its head in shame.
        FEEDBACK: You may think this, but an academic essay is not the place to air such views unless specifically asked to do so by the essay question.  Not the best choice here.

        ANSWER: Housing policy plays an important role in people's mental health and so policies should be put in place that reflect this.
        FEEDBACK: Be careful of the question:  this one asks specifically about physical health.  Make sure your conclusion fits with the essay question.   Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Where you live is quite important and people in charge of housing policy have a duty to remember this.
        FEEDBACK: Apart from the colloquialism (what does 'quite' really mean?), this concluding line is fine, if a little uninspiring.  It's not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: As has been demonstrated, a three-pronged approach to health through public policy has dramatic effects.  Housing is a key part of this approach and if anybody queries the reason why housing policy should always seek to make a contribution towards improving people's physical health, the answer is simple: the contribution actually works.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines have a good ring to them.  Confident and focussed, they leave a good impression.  These lines are the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Poland's not out of the woods yet. 
        FEEDBACK: The expression 'out of the woods' make this concluding line too colloquial for an academic essay.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Until Poland's organs of regional government achieve independence from central government, further development is not possible.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good, solid concluding line because it leaves the reader with something to think about and a sense of closure.  This line is the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: As has been shown, it is difficult to assess exactly why it has been so difficult for Poland to implement a coherent regional policy.  Perhaps things will be clearer in a few more years.
        FEEDBACK: These are unsatisfactory concluding lines.  Even if a definitive answer is not possible, some conclusions should be drawn.  Not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: I think that ethnographers' biggest limitation is understanding other cultures.
        FEEDBACK: This line is too personal (avoid 'I think') and although it makes a statement, feels rather flat.  Not the best option here. 
        ANSWER: The possible limits of anthropological engagement with different cultures and societies?  Understanding.
        FEEDBACK: Including a rhetorical question in your concluding lines smacks of journalism rather than academia.  If you have a statement to make, make it.  Avoid the rhetorical question.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: From all the examples given, one thing is clear:  ethnographers' biggest limitation is not one of engagement with different cultures and societies but one of understanding, and whether it is possible to break through this barrier is highly doubtful.
        FEEDBACK: This is an example of a good concluding line: it does not provide a definitive answer but still says something definite, i.e. that engagement is limited by understanding.  This answers the question set in the essay title and leaves the reader with something positive to think about.  It is the best option here.

        ANSWER: The concept of globalisation is complex.  It does not simply mean that the world is one marketplace.
        FEEDBACK: If you have taken the phrase 'one marketplace' from a source, you must acknowledge that source.  If, however, this idea is your own thought, you don't need hard evidence here since this is your opinion.  You will, though, want to prove your point and this will usually involve examples.
        ANSWER: Globalisation has brought with it a new kind of crime, in which international financial institutions are charged with not supporting poor nations to uphold, for example, globally accepted safety standards.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion does need evidence. Appropriate evidence might include the 2002 sinking of the Senegalese ferry, as analysed by Rothe, Muzzatti and Mullins (2006).  
        ANSWER: The western media, with its wide reach, contributes to the sense that we are all connected.
        FEEDBACK: Although telling examples are always helpful, this kind of general assertion does not need specific evidence.  However, if you are paraphrasing lines you found in a source, you must acknowledge the source both in the text and in the bibliography.

        ANSWER: Illegal arms trafficking compromises public safety.

        ANSWER: A 'food desert' intervention study in Leeds included focus groups as a major part of its design.
        FEEDBACK: This statement does not need specific evidence, although we need a reference for the study, e.g. (Wrigley et al. 2004).  It is highly likely that evidence from the focus groups would be included in the essay.
        ANSWER: Tesco is increasing its market share as Morrison's share is slipping.

This assertion should be followed by:  According to Kantar Worldpanel (in Daily Telegraph 2010a) December 2010 saw Tesco's market share increase to 30.7% from 30.6% whilst Morrison's dipped from 12.1% to 12%.

        ANSWER: Before famine struck, adult males in Ireland consumed massive numbers of potatoes each day.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention numbers, you must give numbers, not rely on colloquialisms like 'massive'.  A better sentence would be: Before famine struck adult males in Ireland consumed on average 70 potatoes each day. <br />
        ANSWER: In conclusion, it is clear that these are the reasons Scotland avoided the famine which was so disastrous for their neighbours across the Irish sea.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.
        FEEDBACK: The phrase 'found many ways' clearly indicates a need for evidence.  You cannot say 'many ways' and not produce at least two fully referenced examples of those ways.  You might, for example, say:  Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.  For example, she undermined relations between cabinet colleagues and appropriated the powers of her Chancellor of the Exchequer (Smith in Rhodes & Dunleavy 1995).
        ANSWER: Thatcher became the British prime minister following the 1979 general election.
        FEEDBACK: This is a well known and incontrovertible fact so doesn't need proof.
        ANSWER: In 1979, there was a big percentage swing to the Conservatives and they won many more seats than Labour.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention percentages and numbers, you need to provide exact figures, not just concepts like 'big' or 'more'.  Here, we need to know that the percentage swing was 5.2% and that the Conservatives won 339 seats against Labour's 269 (BBC 1997).

    QUESTION 0 What is the matter with the comma after 'turn'?
        ANSWER: It's in the wrong place.  It should come after 'restructuring'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  A comma after 'restructuring' would disrupt the sense.
        ANSWER: Nothing.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  As it stands, the comma after 'turn' disrupts the sense of the sentence.
        ANSWER: Since 'in turn' is being used as a sub-clause, there should be a first comma after 'will', which then encloses the sub-clause.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A comma after 'will' would indicate the start of the sub-clause, so the sentence would read:  This cognitive restructuring will, in turn, lead to etc.   Read the example sentence aloud, then read it again with the sub-clause properly enclosed.

        ANSWER: After 'disorder'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A comma here would mark the end of the subclause that begins with the comma after 'disorders'.  When you mark the beginning of a subclause with a comma, make sure you close the subclause with another comma.

INTRO <font size="4">If characteristically, a person is angry are they more likely to suffer from bulimia or anorexia?</font> 
    QUESTION 0 This sentence is missing two commas.  Where should they be placed?
        ANSWER: After 'person' and 'bulimia'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.   A comma after 'person' separates 'person' from 'is' (i.e. separates the subject from its verb) which is nonsensical unless you are inserting a subclause.  A comma after 'bulimia' interrupts the sense of the sentence.
        ANSWER: After 'if' and 'angry'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  'Characteristically' is a one word subclause, so if the subclause closes with the comma after 'characteristically, it opens after 'if'.  A comma after 'angry', helps the sense of the sentence by suggesting a slight pause before the main question.

</ol> 
    QUESTION 0 There should be a comma in sentence 1. Where should it be?
        ANSWER: After 'point'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The verb attached to 'fixation point' is 'seem' and, for the sense of the sentence, it makes no sense to separate the two. 
        ANSWER: After 'move'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  'Move in the same direction' etc. is all one thought.  No comma required.
        ANSWER: After 'however'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  After most adverbs (e.g. however, furthermore, finally, similarly, subsequently) or adverb phrases (e.g. in conclusion, in addition, in the meantime, more importantly) particularly when the adverb or adverb phrase begins a sentence, it should be followed by a comma.  Here are two examples. <br />
    QUESTION 1 One of the commas in sentence 2 should be a full stop.  Which one is it?
        ANSWER: The comma after 'them' should be a full stop.
        FEEDBACK: You may be right. The use of commas in this sentence makes the meaning ambiguous.  Does the phrase 'as is the case with other distant objects' belong with the phrase before or the phrase after?  It's impossible to know.  This is why correctly placing commas and full stops is so important.

    QUESTION 0 In sentence 1, do we need a semi-colon after 'caused by'? 
        ANSWER: Yes.  We need a semi-colon before a quote.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Sometimes it's appropriate to introduce a quote with a colon, but unless the quote is part of a list, it's very seldom correct to introduce a quote with a semi-colon.  In this context, there's no need for anything since the quote is incorporated into the sense of the sentence.
        ANSWER: No.  We don't need anything here.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Sometimes it's appropriate to introduce a quote with a colon, but unless the quote is part of a list, it's very seldom correct to introduce a quote with a semi-colon.  In this context, there's no need for anything since the quote is incorporated into the sense of the sentence.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does!  Punctuation is essential for clarity.  The poor punctuation in this sentence trips the reader up.
    QUESTION 1 Do we need the semi-colon after 'is that'?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  We never need a colon after 'that' because it introduces an unnatural pause.  If you are introducing a list with 'that', as here, the start of your list flows on from your sentence.  
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right. We never need a colon after 'that' because it introduces an unnatural pause.  If you are introducing a list with 'that', as here, the start of your list flows on from your sentence.
    QUESTION 2 Do we need a comma after 'cancer'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  'Like cancer' is sub-clause, adding a little more information.  The writer has introduced the sub-clause with a comma after 'depression' but hasn't closed the sub-clause after 'cancer'. 
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.   'Like cancer' is sub-clause, adding a little more information.  The writer has introduced the sub-clause with a comma after 'depression' but hasn't closed the sub-clause after 'cancer'.
    QUESTION 3 Is the comma after 'gone wrong' correct?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. The comma is muddling, since it does not make it clear that what follows is a new (though connected) thought.  This is the place for a semi-colon, which gives the reader a much better 'sentence map'.  
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. The comma is muddling, since it does not make it clear that what follows is a new (though connected) thought.  This is the place for a semi-colon, which gives the reader a much better 'sentence map'.
    QUESTION 4 In sentence 2, is the semi-colon after 'human emotion' needed?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Why do we need a pause here?  A pause here disrupts rather than clarifies.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.   A pause here disrupts rather than clarifies.
    QUESTION 5 Here are two different rewrites of sentence 2.  Which is clearer?
1. Wolpert's (2007) perspective as to why depression still exists is that firstly depression, like cancer, is a normal process gone wrong; in a depressive disorder sadness is out of control and like the cells that grow into cancer sadness is such an important human emotion that evolution cannot easily overcome it.

2.  Wolpert's (2007) perspective on depression's continued existence is that firstly, depression, like cancer, is a normal process gone wrong; secondly that in a depressive disorder, sadness, just like the cells that grow into cancer, is out of control;  and thirdly, that sadness is such an important human emotion that evolution cannot easily overcome it. 
        ANSWER: No. 1 is the best.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The first sentence has 'firstly' but no 'secondly', which unbalances it.  In addition, the two thoughts at the end are muddled.  Cancer is not an 'important human emotion', though this is what the sentence actually says.
        ANSWER: No. 2 is best.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The addition of 'secondly' and 'thirdly' not only balances the sentence, it also removes the muddle that, in sentence 1, implies that cancer is an important human emotion.  Correct phrasing and punctuation are essential to make your meaning unambiguous.

        ANSWER: Yes, to introduce what Beck's theory says. 
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  What Beck's theory says is incorporated into the sentence, not set apart from it.  The semi-colon interrupts the flow, hindering rather than helping the reader. 
        ANSWER: No.  Beck's theory is incorporated into the flow of the sentence.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  What Beck's theory says is incorporated into the sentence, not set apart from it.  The semi-colon interrupts the flow, hindering rather than helping the reader.

    QUESTION 0 There should be a semi-colon in this sentence.  Where should it be placed?
        ANSWER: After 'that'.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Such a placing would interrupt the flow of the sentence, hindering rather than helping the reader.
        ANSWER: After 'found'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree - and we might also have a comma after 'for example'.   A semi-colon after 'found' offers a small pause before the example. The pause allows the reader to take in what's been said.   A very appropriate use of the semi-colon.
        ANSWER: After 'for example'.
        FEEDBACK: That wouldn't be correct as it encourages the reader to pause in a place that disrupts the flow.  In speech, you wouldn't pause here, so why insert a pause into the text?

INTRO <font size="4">CBT's popularity really began in the 1960s after psychologist Aaron Beck (1963) developed a successful CBT treatment for depression (Beck et al., 1979) and today it is claimed to be successful in the treatment of many psychological disorders including anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. CBT adopts a &quot;hands on&quot;, practical and goal oriented approach using a variety of techniques including general relaxation, problem solving and cognitive restructuring. Specifically, its application is broken down into three phases. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Where should the new paragraph start?
        ANSWER: This is fine as one paragraph: the new paragraph should start right at the end, after 'three phases'. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The 'three phases' belong to the description of the "hands on" approach and should not be separated from it. 
        ANSWER: After "post traumatic stress disorder".
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This phrase finishes the history of CBT.  The phrase 'CBT adopts' begins to describe the procedure.
        ANSWER: After "cognitive restructuring".
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The word "Specifically", which starts the next sentence, shows that the topic is ongoing, with more information being given.

INTRO Sukhodolsky, Kassinove and Gorman (2004) advanced the CBT debate stating that although positive effects for anger and aggression are well documented, little is known about the individual components that make it work or about its exportability from clinical research to practice. This was an area in which further studies were ongoing. In contrast to Cole (2008), the 2004 study of Sukhodolky et al. addressed the &quot;file drawer&quot; problem comprehensively, with 19 of the 40 studies not published and a calculated &quot;fail-safe&quot;<sup>1</sup> to ensure that their results were not influenced. The &quot;file-drawer&quot; problem, however, remains a difficulty with many other studies. 
    QUESTION 0 Where should the new paragraph start?
        ANSWER: After "practice".
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The next sentence, begins "This was an area", so we are clearly on the same topic.
        ANSWER: There shouldn't be one.  
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think there is a new topic in this text.  Try again.
        ANSWER: After "ongoing".

Spaniards, it was discovered, made more above the shoulder hand movements. However, no difference was perceived in the number of gestures. Muller (1998) suggests that because the Spaniards' hand gestures were above the shoulder, they created a more abundant impression. One study which empirically investigated cultural differences in hand gestures used US and Taiwanese mothers (Goldin-Meadow &amp; Saltzman, 2000). The results of this interaction were significant.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Where should the new paragraph start?
        ANSWER: After "Spaniards".
        FEEDBACK: If this sentence came after a long piece of unbroken text, it would be right to start a new paragraph after it.  "Spaniards" can easily be seen as a new topic.  If, however, the text is already broken up into small paragraphs, there is no need for a new paragraph here.  Think of the reader.  What will they find easiest?

However, at the end of the study, the group with no training were found to have performed significantly better at lie detection than the trained group. In another, similar, study, Mann, Frij and Bull (2006) also discovered that when lie detecting personnel followed the cues outlined in police manuals, their lie detection accuracy was reduced. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Where should the new paragraph start?

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We are still on the same topic here:   the accuracy of lie detection.
        ANSWER: We don't need a new paragraph.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think this is a whole paragraph about the accuracy of lie detection and, as presented here, doesn't need dividing up.  If, however, there was lots more information about the Mann, Frij and Bull study, we would need a new paragraph after "trained group" because this new study would be a new topic rather than an extension of the existing topic.
        ANSWER: Between "indicate deceit" and "However".
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  "However" does sometimes herald a new paragraph, but as this text is set out, we're still on the topic of accuracy and the text should flow on.

    QUESTION 1 Do we need 'the' before 'time judgments'?

        ANSWER: Yes.

This is because we can use the word 'underestimation' and the phrases 'negative slides' and 'positive slides' either as specific examples or as concepts.  In this context, both make sense.

        Task multiplechoice difficulty 2
INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Show how psychology as a science can explore any one problem, e.g. autism, depression, aggression, from various perspectives and levels ranging from social behaviour to basic biology.</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Which of the following are the best opening lines for this essay title?  Each choice has an explanation, so it's worth clicking on them all, even if your first choice agrees with ours.
        ANSWER: Mental disorders are controversial concepts. 'In contrast to physical illness diagnoses, there are no clear physical criteria for mental illnesss' (Passer, 2009, p. 784).  However, psychological evaluation has helped to explore and develop our understanding of mental illnesses such as depression as common 'problems in living' as opposed to purely 'inner disorders' (Szasz, 1963, as in Passer et al., 2009).
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These lines are not wrong, but could you tell, from reading them, what the essay title is?  There are no echoes of the essay title, so the reader is a little in the dark.  Opening lines need, very specifically, to refer to the terms of the essay title.  Without a specific reference, the essay risks veering wildly off course. 
        ANSWER: As a science, psychology is uniquely equipped to explore, from many perspectives, problems that have psychological as well as physical dimensions.  Employing experimental behavioural techniques as well as basic biological tests, psychology fills in gaps left by purely physical diagnoses.  Using depression as an example, this essay will show how psychology, as a science, goes about its important work.  Firstly, it will look at diagnostic techniques; secondly, at genetic factors; and thirdly, at differing theories, and the effects these theories have had on treatments.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  These lines grasp the essay title, echoing its terms:  psychology as a science; explore; problem; perspectives.  They also provide a coherent essay plan, and all in 84 words.
        ANSWER: Psychology is defined as the 'scientific study of human or other animal mental functions and behaviours' (Wikipedia). It also has a long history, and in this essay I am going to look at the different approaches psychology has taken to examine the problem of depression.  Depression is a condition which makes sufferer feels 'sad, discouraged, apathetic and passive' (Passer et al., 2009).

Then, although we're told what the essay is going to do, the stress is on the history of approaches to depression.  This is veering away from the essay title.  If you keep the essay title in mind, you won't veer off like this.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Outline the main cues in depth perception.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Read the title of the essay.  Which are the best opening lines?
        ANSWER: The following essay will outline the main cues for depth perception.  Depth perception can be described as the way in which the individual perceives objects as having three dimensions.  This means individuals see objects as having depth and thickness as well as height and width.  Some parts of an object seem further away than others.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The first sentence is unnecessary.  It's good to echo the terms of the essay title but not good simply to repeat the title without adding anything.  We then have three sentences telling us the same thing but in different words.  One sentence will do here.
        ANSWER: The main cues for depth perception, i.e. how an individual perceives objects as having three dimensions, can be grouped in two broad categories: stimulus cues and visual system cues.  This essay will look firstly at stimulus cues, then at visual system cues.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is a crisp, no-nonsense opening, which gives a clear, concise definition and tells the reader exactly what to expect. 
        ANSWER: The history of our understanding of depth perception is long and complicated, since for centuries it was something we took for granted rather than analysed.  We have only really understood the physical reactions that underpin depth perception since the introduction of sophisticated equipment for tracking the effects of vision on our brains.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This may be all be true (or it may not be - where are the references?) but the essay question is very precise, and your essay must very precisely answer it.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Describe and explain kin selection and reciprocal altruism.<br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Which are the best opening lines for this essay question?
        ANSWER: Altruism is a pro-social helping behaviour which seems both difficult to explain and to describe.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is a personal opinion.  It adds nothing to the essay except to undermine the reader's confidence in what is to come. Also, why start with altruism when the essay title clearly lists kin selection first?  In your opening lines, try to echo the terms of the question.  That will let your reader know you've actually read it ...
        ANSWER: Kin selection was first outlined by R.A. Fisher, but it was 'W. D. Hamilton who truly formalised the concept, in works published in 1963 and - most importantly - in 1964' (Wikipedia).  Reciprocal altruism  suggests that 'altruism could have evolved since it might be beneficial to incur this cost if there is a chance of being in a reverse situation where the person whom I helped before may perform an altruistic act towards me' (Trivers, 1971, as in Wikipedia). 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Wikipedia is not a reliable source and should never be used in academic essays.  However, if you find the original text - Wikipedia has references at the bottom of its articles - then quotations are often a good way to start an essay, though they should not be quite this long.
        ANSWER: In my view, there is no such thing as altruistic behaviour, and kin selection cannot work as it is completely at odds with Darwin's theory of classical fitness.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is a personal opinion.  What's more, the essay is a discursive essay, i.e. it does not ask you to argue for or against the concepts of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, it asks you to describe and explain.   Not a good choice. 
        ANSWER: Kin selection, the theory that 'organisms are most likely to help others with whom they share the most genes, namely, their offspring and genetic relatives' (Passer, Smith, Holt, Bremner, Sutherland
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  From these two sentences, we know what we are talking about and where we are going.  Note also how other approaches to this essay are acknowledged - 'social learning, cultural differences or other observed behaviours'.  This is an excellent way of showing that you know more than there is space to write about.

    QUESTION 0 Remember:  these are the opening lines of the abstract (i.e. NOT the introduction or the main body of the text).
        ANSWER: The impact of alcohol on cognitive function matters because of the impact of binge drinking on western societies.  This Review reviews four key papers with reference to two specific experimental designs: cognitive studies; and brain imaging studies.
        FEEDBACK: Clear and informative.   These opening lines bode well for the remainder of the abstract.  An excellent option.
        ANSWER: The impact of alcohol on cognitive function matters because of the impact of binge drinking on western societies.  Our alcohol consumption severely stretches our criminal justice system and has detrimental effects on family life.  In Scotland alone, 47% of violent crime is alcohol related (Scottish Crime and Justice Survey, 2008-09). 
        FEEDBACK: The facts about crime and alcohol may be correct, but if thought relevant to this paper, should be placed in the introduction.  The abstract is an overview of this paper.  That's its function.  Not a good option.
        ANSWER: The impact of alcohol on cognitive function matters because of the impact of binge drinking on western societies.  This paper will look at several areas of neuropsychological function including pre-natal exposure, exposure in adolescence and gender difference.  Finally, it will assess what we can learn from these areas.
        FEEDBACK: These lines read like the opening lines of an essay.  The abstract is a complete overview of the Critical Review.  It does not tell us what you WILL look at, but what you HAVE looked at, and what your conclusions are.  Not the best option.

    QUESTION 0 Remember:  these are the opening lines of the abstract (i.e. NOT the introduction).
        ANSWER: Love is one of the most desired experiences (Debiec, 2007) within human nature.  None of us can do without it without severe detriment to our wellbeing.  Its definition in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is of 'an intense feeling of deep affection or fondness for a person or thing, a sexual passion, or sexual relations'.
        FEEDBACK: The first line here is fine, and the reference adds authority.  But then the text meanders off, wasting words in repetition.   There is no room for meandering in an abstract.  Not the best option.
        ANSWER: Love is one of the most desired experiences (Debiec, 2007) and the focus of much scientific literature.  This Review focused on the role of neurotransmitters in lower mammals such as prairie voles (Zeki, 2007); then assessed Bartels and Zeki's 2004 study of the neural correlates of maternal and romantic love in humans; and finally analysed the neural basis of unconditional love in both humans, as investigated by Beauregard (2009).  
        FEEDBACK: These lines are crisp and informative.  The past tense - focused - shows the writer has understood the function of his/her abstract, which is to allow a reader to see at once whether this particular Critical Review contains what they are looking for.
        ANSWER: Love is one of the most desired experiences (Debiec, 2007).  Firstly, this paper is going to look at the role of neurotransmitters in lower mammals such as prairie voles (Zeki, 2007); secondly, it will assess the neural correlates of maternal and romantic love;  thirdly, it will analyse the neural basis of unconditional love and finally, it will evaluate the value of these studies and suggest where further research is needed.
        FEEDBACK: The writer of these lines has mistaken their function.  Your abstract should be an overview of your whole Critical Review, conclusions included.  These lines read more like the start of an essay.

    QUESTION 0 Remember: these are the opening lines of the abstract (i.e. NOT the introduction).
        ANSWER: This paper will consider the distortions of attentional model of time perception and the affective influence of time estimation, using the example of fear.  
        FEEDBACK: What is the point of simply repeating the title of the Critical Review?  Opening lines must engage the reader, and offer a way into the Review.
        ANSWER: Our perception of time is subjective, yet various measures can be used to assess the influence of emotions such as fear on our subjective perceptions.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are crisp and informative.  A good start to the abstract.  
        ANSWER: 'When you are sitting with a nice girl for two yours, you think it is only a minute.  But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think it is two hours.  That is relativity.'  Thus said Albert Einstein (as in Cohen, 1964).
        FEEDBACK: A nice quotation, but in my opinion, although it may be suitable for the Introduction, it's not suitable for the abstract of this Critical Review.  The abstract, which is word limited, needs to give an overview of the whole Critical Review and this quotation takes up too many words, without sufficient bang for the buck - a useful Americanism - if you see what I mean.

        Task multiplechoice difficulty 2
INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /></font><br /><font size="4">Why do we obey?</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Which concluding lines are the best for this essay title? 
        ANSWER: So, why do we obey?  The simple answer is another question: why not?
        FEEDBACK: This may seem clever, but is in fact nonsense!  Concluding lines should certainly echo the terms of the question, but they should leave the reader impressed by your scholarship, not your quirkiness.
        ANSWER: It seems that there are three clear reasons as to why we are likely to obey:  subservience to a perceived legitimate authority;  removal of direct responsibility; and the desire to keep in with the crowd.  Milgram's 1963 experiment demonstrated all these reasons and Burger's rerun in 2009 shows us that the answers to the question 'why do we obey' have not changed.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is an excellent conclusion, wrapping up the essay clearly and concisely.
        ANSWER: Miligram, then Burger, illustrated obedience very well in their experiments, and we do not appear to have altered much between 1963 and 2009.  Therefore the answer to the question 'why do we obey' is still the same as the answer to be found in Milgram's conclusion, and there is no reason to believe that things will change.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This conclusion is not terrible at all, but we need specifics - i.e. to be reminded, specifically but concisely, of what Milgram's conclusions were - if the essay is to remain tight.

    QUESTION 0 Which are the best concluding lines to this essay?  All the lines have explanations, so even if you are right first time, it is worth skimming through them all.
        ANSWER: As this essay has shown, there are many different approaches to personality, from Galen to Freud, from Allport to Cattell's list of personality factors.  All feed into our notion of what a person is and all, therefore, have value.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These lines may be coherent, but they do not relate to the essay question.  You can write the best essay in the world, but if it doesn't grasp and answer the question set, it has failed in its purpose.
        ANSWER: I think that the trait theory approach to personality works when when attempting to measure individual personalities.  It is much better than other theories and, as I've shown, seems to manage a fair degree of accuracy.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These closing lines are too personal and informal in style:  'I think', 'I've shown'.  And what is a 'fair degree' of accuracy?  Academic essays must be objective and precise.  
        ANSWER: As has been shown, the trait theory approach to personality, through embracing variety, has proven itself a valuable tool in the dissection of individuals' personalities.  However, as has also been shown, the multitude of varieties is very hard to manage, particularly amid the multitude of combinations.  Trait theory, however, by not fixing individuals into types, can claim an accuracy that broader theories cannot claim, and for this reason is of greater value.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  These lines reveal clearly what the essay has been discussing, and are relevant to the essay title.

    QUESTION 0 Which are the best concluding lines for this essay?
        ANSWER: I believe that compromise reaches out further towards the cause of the disorder as it takes into account both the biological hard-wiring that one is born with, the effect of narcotics and toxins in the pre-natal stage and the circumstances in which one grows up in.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  What does 'compromise reaches out further' actually mean?  The phrase 'it takes into account BOTH' is then followed by three items, the last of which is a jumble of words - 'in which one grows up in'. Some of the content may be good, but the style is off-putting.  Not a good choice. 
        ANSWER: It is clear, then, that biological explanations are insufficient to account for ADHD, and that although research into genetics and brain anomalies presents good evidence, psychological and environmental factors cannot be disregarded. 
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This concluding line answers the essay question with clarity and precision.
        ANSWER: The causes of ADHD are difficult to pin down.  What we do know is that the condition causes a great deal of suffering that that the sooner we get to the bottom of the causes, the better.
        FEEDBACK: This is journalese, i.e. it might do for an article in a newspaper or magazine but it's too general and vague for an academic essay.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title, then choose which you think are the best concluding lines. Every choice has an explanation, so even if you choose correctly first time, it's worth skimming through them all.</font> 
        ANSWER: Through the work of Ramachandran and others, it cannot be doubted that mirror therapy is effective in treating phantom limb pain.  However, the small sample size used prohibits mirror therapy being hailed as the ultimate treatment.  Future trials look set to remedy this current lack of data, and if these trials prove as successful as all previous trials, mirror therapy looks set to be the therapy of choice for all those suffering phantom limb pain.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This sums up clearly and succinctly, and answers the question.  What more do you want from concluding lines!
        ANSWER: Phantom limb pain is really terrible for sufferers.  Mirror therapy has received a great deal of clinical and scientific attention in academic publications and seems set to be the therapy of the future.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Although perfectly readable, these lines are vague and unspecific.  The phrase 'really terrible' has no place in an academic essay.  Good concluding lines for an academic essay should leave the reader confident of the writer's authority.  I don't think these lines achieve that.  
        ANSWER: Whilst all the disadvantages of mirror therapy need to be erased in order to determine the true effectiveness of mirror therapy as a suitable treatment for phantom limb pain, the majority can be overcome by implementing a randomized controlled research design.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These lines are too wordy and imprecise.  Do you really 'erase' disadvantages?  The writer may know his or her stuff, but these concluding lines don't inspire confidence.

INTRO <div style="text-align: center;"><font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</font><br /></div><font size="4"><br />Ostracism can have a huge effect on an individual both physiologically and psychologically. A considerable amount of research has been done looking at ostracism and the reaction it elicits. However, less has been completed looking at why these reactions are induced. Experimental evidence has shown that social exclusion can elicit both pro and anti social responses. However as of yet no consensus has been made on what factors lead to these reactions. We suggest that response to ostracism is controlled by a variety of items including situational factors and individual differences. We argue that although these are not the only factors important in influencing reaction to ostracism each of these is valuable. This Critical Review will then conclude with suggestions for further research and a summary of the main points being made within this Review.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 An abstract is an overview of a whole Critical Review, including the conclusions and suggestions for further work.   Would you say this was a good example?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This example tells us what the Critical Review is going to do, which would be fine for the first paragraph of an essay, but is not fine in the abstract of a Critical Review.

    QUESTION 2 Is every word properly used?
        ANSWER: No.  
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think the very first word - ostracism - should actually be 'Being ostracised'.  This shows that ostracism is something that happens to you, which is important to remember.  I'm also unhappy with 'induced'.  It's not absolutely wrong, but it certainly jolts the reader.  I think 'reactions to it' would be simpler and more comprehensible.

Issues with using non verbal behaviours to detect deceit in a multicultural environment.<br /><br /></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span></font><br /></div><font size="4"><br />Evidence exists which suggests that non-verbal behaviours are commonly used in a variety of applied settings. Specifically, this evidence suggests they are important in police interviews, where they are used to detect deceit. However, a body of empirical evidence also exists which demonstrates that non verbal behaviours vary across cultures. This Critical Review will analyze whether cross cultural differences in specific non-verbal behaviours will result in ethnic individuals being misperceived as deceptive in police interviews. In order for this misperception to take place a culture's natural display of non verbal behaviours must match the profile of non-verbal behaviours which police officers believe indicate deceit. This Critical Review will impose a new structure on already existing evidence to investigate whether this problem exists. The structure of the Review is three fold. Section One .... Section Two ... Section Three. It will then conclude that cross cultural difference in the amount of eye contact displayed by Black, Hispanic and Japanese individuals could lead to them being perceived as deceptive when they are innocent.<br /><br /><br /></font>

Introduction:<br /><br /></font><font size="4">The argument that bilinguals and monolinguals are neurologically different has been a controversial area in psychology for years. The first studies involved studying bilingual aphasics who, following brain injury, would have retained only one of their two languages. Although no valid evidence was found to support the theory that the two languages were stored in different brain areas, it paved the way for neuro-imaging studies which sought to discover the neurological differences in bilingual and monolingual language areas (Guissani et al., 2007). <br /><br /></font><font size="4">Example 2. Introduction:</font><br /><br /><font size="4">For nearly a century, psychologists have disagreed about the existence of neurological differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. The first studies examined bilingual aphasics who, following brain injury, retained only one of their languages. Although these studies produced no valid evidence to support the theory that different languages are stored in different brain areas, neuro-imaging techniques opened up the possibility of discovering for certain whether this was true or not. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the content of both these examples appropriate for the introduction?
        ANSWER: Yes.

        ANSWER: No.  One introduction is better than the other.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.
    QUESTION 2 Which example works better?
        ANSWER: Example 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Example 1 is clumsily phrased.  For example, arguments are, by definition, controversial;  if there are studies, clearly somebody has been studying;  bilingual means two languages, so why repeat 'two'?  The style of an introduction can either undermine or inspire confidence.  Good content can be wrecked by poor style.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sentences deserves a place in an introduction?
        ANSWER: All of them.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  They are all interesting but I would argue that not all deserve a place in the introduction to a Critical Review.
        ANSWER: Sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This encapsulates the essence of Piaget.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is padding.  What does it add to your Critical Review?
        ANSWER: Sentence 3.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This describe's Piaget's method, which is key to understanding his theories.
        ANSWER: Sentence 4.
        FEEDBACK: Quotes from Wikipedia have no place in an academic text.   Wikipedia is unreliable.
        ANSWER: Sentence 5.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This expands on Piaget's theory and is essential to the reader's understanding.
        ANSWER: Sentence 6.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This explains very clearly the purpose of the Critical Review.
    QUESTION 1 Does it matter if some information in the introduction is also found in the abstract?
        ANSWER: Yes.  You should not repeat yourself.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  An abstract is an overview of the whole of a Critical Review, so some of the information will be repeated, although it will be much more concise in the abstract.   If you're not clear about this, go to the separate section on abstracts.
        ANSWER: No - this is bound to happen.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  An abstract is an overview of the whole of a Critical Review, so some of the information will be repeated, although it will be much more concise in the abstract.   If you're not clear about this, go to the separate section on abstracts.

    QUESTION 0 A detailed history of the problem or topic from its first appearance in psychological literature to the present day?
        ANSWER: Yes.  
        FEEDBACK: I disagree in one respect:  we need to have the problem or topic set in context, and this may involve a short history.  But don't get too carried away with historical facts and dates.  Your Critical Review is a Critical Review, not a historical perspective.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree up to a point.  The introduction is certainly the place to set the problem or topic in context, and this may involve a short history.  But you would be right not to get too carried away with historical facts and dates.  Your Critical Review is a Critical Review, not a historical perspective.
    QUESTION 1 An description of the studies on which you are going to focus?
        ANSWER: No.  They should have sections of their own.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  By the end of the introduction, the reader should know what literature is under scrutiny.  This doesn't mean that you can't also have sections on each piece of literature, if that seems appropriate for your particular Review.
        ANSWER: Yes.  The reader will expect this.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  By the end of the introduction, the reader should know what literature is under scrutiny.  This doesn't mean that you can't also have sections on each piece of literature, if that seems appropriate for your particular Review.
    QUESTION 2 An idea of the practical and theoretical implications of your Review?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Thinking about the practical and theoretical implications of your Review does not mean you have to prejudge your conclusions; only that you should be able to justify the focus of your Review.
        ANSWER: No. That should be reserved for the Results/Discussion section.

        ANSWER: Yes.  It says what has been looked at in the Critical Review and what conclusions were drawn.
        FEEDBACK: The paragraph certainly tells us what is in the Critical Review, but this is unnecessary.  In the discussion section, we need to launch straight into evaluation and comparison.

    QUESTION 1 Regarding style:  does this paragraph's style, i.e. use of language and sentence construction, inspire confidence?
        ANSWER: You may have to read it a few times, but it does eventually make sense.
        FEEDBACK: You're right - but the reader should not have to decypher it.  Anything you write must be comprehensible first time. In this text, sentences run on, words are wrongly used, punctuation is poor.

        FEEDBACK: It does say what it means, but the tone it strikes is not academic.  You must choose your words to fit your audience.
        ANSWER: No.  It's too informal.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. Though it says what it means, the tone it strikes is not academic.  You must choose your words to fit your audience.
    QUESTION 1 Where might this style be appropriate?  
        ANSWER: In a psychology journal.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Most psychology journals would send this back to the writer.
        ANSWER: A personal letter or email.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A chatty tone is often highly appropriate for a letter or email.
        ANSWER: A newspaper.
        FEEDBACK: I agree, though this is tabloid 'journalese'.  A broadsheet newspaper would not like 'pretty rubbish' though they might not mind 'really tough' or 'slapped on'.

    QUESTION 0 Does this text strike the right tone for an academic assignment?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It says what it means.
        FEEDBACK: It does say what it means, but the tone is too chatty.  We find 'it's' rather than 'it is' and the colloquialism 'a lot of', which is too vague to be informative.  Also, the phrases 'horrible seeing drunks' and 'really interesting' are phrases we might use when we're talking or writing an informal letter or email.  They are more journalistic than academic.
        ANSWER: No - the tone isn't right.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The meaning is clear but the tone is too chatty.  We find 'it's' rather than 'it is' and the colloquialism 'a lot of', which is too vague to be informative.  Also, the phrases 'horrible seeing drunks' and 'really interesting' are phrases we might use when we're talking or writing an informal letter or email.  They are more journalistic than academic.

    QUESTION 0 Is sentence 1 subjective or objective?
        ANSWER: Subjective.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Although the writer uses 'we', he or she cites a source.  This turns what looks like a subjective opinion into an objective observation.
        ANSWER: Objective.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Although the writer uses 'we', he or she cites a source.  This turns what looks like a subjective opinion into an objective observation.
    QUESTION 1 Is sentence 2 subjective or objective?

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sentences is too general?
        ANSWER: None of them - they are all specific enough.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Sentence 1.

        ANSWER: All of them.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Go to the next question.
    QUESTION 1 How could sentence 1 be made more specific?
        ANSWER: By listing other reasons for child referral.
        FEEDBACK: Possibly, but there's a better way.  Try again.
        ANSWER: By saying what kind of anger.
        FEEDBACK: I don't think that would be the answer.
        ANSWER: By citing a source.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  If you cite your source, that adds authority and also grounds your statement in specific evidence.
    QUESTION 2 How could sentence 2 be made less general?
        ANSWER: By listing the negative outcomes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree, particularly if you cite a source.  Everything must be evidence based.
        ANSWER: By describing the anger in more detail.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We need something stronger than that.  Try again.
        ANSWER: By adding the word 'adolescent' before 'anger'.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  We need more than that.

        FEEDBACK: That wouldn't quite solve the problem.
        ANSWER: By exchanging 'most of' and 'quite' for more specific indicators.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Phrases like 'most of' and words like 'quite' are too general to be of any value in an academic essay.

    QUESTION 0 How can we turn sentence 1 from a generality into something more specific?
        ANSWER: By listing some of the studies.
        FEEDBACK: That would not get to the root of the problem.
        ANSWER: By listing the treatments.
        FEEDBACK: That would not help.
        ANSWER: By exchanging the phrase 'a few' with a definite number.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  That's the best and most effective way of making this sentence very specific.
    QUESTION 1 How could we make sentence 2 more specific?
        ANSWER: By listing the pains suffered.
        FEEDBACK: That would not get to the root of the problem.
        ANSWER: By replacing 'several' with the actual number.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This would be by far the best option.
        ANSWER: By removing '33' so that no number appears.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  That would make the problem worse!
    QUESTION 2 Is the problems with sentence 3 the word 'random'?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The problem lies elsewhere.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The problem lies in the phrase 'most of'.  We need a percentage here.  'Most of' is too general.

        ANSWER: Explain the meaning of 'biological'.
        FEEDBACK: I don't think that would solve the problem.
        ANSWER: Give ADHD its full title.
        FEEDBACK: No - that wouldn't help at all.
        ANSWER: Add more information.
        FEEDBACK: I agree. This would be better:  'It may be concluded that ADHD is largely a biological condition in the sense that a link can be demonstrated between sufferers of ADHD and physiological and genetic abormalities.'
    QUESTION 1 Following on from the correct answer to question 2, what would make this sentence even more specific?
        ANSWER: Adding even more information.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. Too much information in one sentence simply muddles.
        ANSWER: Adding a reference.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The sentence would then look like this:   'It may be concluded that ADHD is largely a biological condition in the sense that a link can be demonstrated between sufferers of ADHD and physiological and genetic abormalities (Gerlach, 2009).
        ANSWER: Removing 'largely'.

    QUESTION 0 How might we make sentence 1 more specific?
        ANSWER: By giving the number of key stages.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Definite numbers are essential.
        ANSWER: By removing the word 'several'.
        FEEDBACK: There's a better way.  Try again.
        ANSWER: By putting in Freud's first name.
        FEEDBACK: That wouldn't help.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 How could we make sentence 2 less general?
        ANSWER: By listing some of the classifications.
        FEEDBACK: That might be marginally better, but it's not the best way.  Try again.
        ANSWER: By saying who invented Trait Theory.
        FEEDBACK: That might be interesting but it wouldn't solve the problem.  Try again.
        ANSWER: By replacing 'a lot' with a number.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Always use a figure if you can. If you can't, avoid 'a lot'.  It means nothing.  If you can't think of a suitable replacement, leave it out altogether.
    QUESTION 2 How can we make sentence 3 less general?
        ANSWER: By listing some personality disorders that personality mapping has helped to treat.
        FEEDBACK: That wouldn't get to the root of the problem.
        ANSWER: Saying what you mean by personality mapping.
        FEEDBACK: That wouldn't get to the root of the problem.  Try again.
        ANSWER: Replacing 'really' with a measurement.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Always use a specific measurement if you can.  If you can't, at least cite a source.  That stops your statement being a vague generalisation.

    QUESTION 0 Which sentence has avoided being too general?
        ANSWER: Sentence 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Any sentence with 'a lot of' or 'lots of' is too general.  Always use a proper measurement - preferably with a citation attached.
        ANSWER: Sentence 2.
        FEEDBACK: I agree that this is better than sentence 1, but it doesn't quite escape being too general if a list of the differences doesn't follow immediately.
        ANSWER: Sentence 3.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This sentence prepares us to receive very specific information.

        FEEDBACK: I think these details are helpful, so I'd leave them in.
        ANSWER: The important words in the titles should be capitalised.
        FEEDBACK: The APA, whose guidelines Psychology follow, like titles capitalised within the text, but not in the References section.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The title of the journal in which the study appears should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  Italicising titles makes them immediately obvious, thus helping with quick identification.

    QUESTION 0 Should SAMHSA be written out in full in the References section, even if it has been written out in full when first mentioned in the text?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  In the References section it should read Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  In the References section it should read Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter.  The point of the References section is that readers should be able, without effort, to see your source.  Writing out the name in full helps.
    QUESTION 1 There is another mistake in this reference.  What is it?
        ANSWER: 'Results from 2005 survey' etc. should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Only the titles of books or journals should be italicised, not the titles of articles, reports or results.
        ANSWER: There should not be a capital letter after the colon.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  APA style recommends a capital after a colon.
        ANSWER: The website URL should be given in full.

        ANSWER: The issue number.
        FEEDBACK: No, not that.  This is clearly a book entry.
        ANSWER: The date of publication.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  It's really important to put that in, directly after the author's name.
        ANSWER: The country of publication.
        FEEDBACK: No, the city is enough.
    QUESTION 1 Is the title properly formatted?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No - the title of the book should be italicised.  This makes the title immediately apparent to the reader.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  The title of the book should be italicised.  This makes the title immediately apparent to the reader.
    QUESTION 2 There is something wrong with the formatting of the publisher and place of publication.  What is it?
        ANSWER: There should be no ampersand between 'Routledge' and 'Keagan'.  The 'and' should be written in full.
        FEEDBACK: No - if there is an ampersand in the publisher's printed name, that is how it should appear in your reference.
        ANSWER: The city of publication should come before the publisher, and be separated from the publisher's name with a colon.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.
        ANSWER: We need 'UK', not London.
        FEEDBACK: No - the city of publication is correct.  You might put in the name of the country if there might be a misunderstanding, i.e. Manchester, New Hampshire (to differentiate from Manchester in England).

        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right. The title of the book should be italicised.
    QUESTION 2 In the book reference, is the date in the right place?

        FEEDBACK: No, it's not.  The date should come after the authors.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  The date should come after the authors.
    QUESTION 3 There's something missing from the book reference.  What is it?
        ANSWER: The span of pages.
        FEEDBACK: No.  Page spans are needed for journal references but not for books.  If you directly quote from a book, you need the page number in your in-text reference.  In the References section, for a chapter in an edited book (i.e. where there is one editor, with different authors contributing different chapters) you should put down the chapter number.  The same goes for a particularly entry in a reference book.
        ANSWER: The publisher's name.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  Although we have the date, we need the publisher's name.  That will help the reader, since often books are published more than once, and by different publishing firms.
    QUESTION 4 In the web example, should the title of the web-book be italicised?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  Titles of books put onto the web should be italicised.
        ANSWER: No.

    QUESTION 0 Which words/phrases are wrong or wrongly put together here?
        ANSWER: effective
        FEEDBACK: No, this is fine.  Effective means 'to have an effect'.   (If you thought this should be 'affective', that would be incorrect.  Affective is a word meaning 'arousing the emotions'.
        ANSWER: creating a method to be 100% accurate
        FEEDBACK: Well done.  You don't 'create a method to be', you 'create a method that is'.  When you read, take note of these phrases and try to express them correctly.
        ANSWER: in regards to
        FEEDBACK: Well done.  This is a common mistake that irritates markers no end.  The expression is not 'in regard to'.  It could be 'WITH regard to'.  The example sentence would read much better as 'Regarding personality, one major theory is trait theory'.

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This hypothesis contains information about the interpretation of the results - i.e. 'due to the way the memory encodes verbal reasoning'.  A hypothesis should predict the results and nothing else.  Not the best choice.
        ANSWER: Hypothesis 3 is the best.

        FEEDBACK: It does indeed do both those things, but read the title of the mini-project.  The passage and the title may be related, but this relationship is not pointed out, so the information, whilst correct, is irrelevant. 
        ANSWER: 2 is spot-on because it links anthropomorphism and the paranormal. 
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Passage 2 does link anthropomorphism and the paranormal but in a vague way.  Vague is never good in a project report.
        ANSWER: 3 is spot-on because it links the paranormal and anthropomorphism and cites a relevant study.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Passage 3 links all the elements of the project together and provides a rationale for the experiment.  This is exactly what the introduction should do.

INTRO <font size="4">Method<br /><br />Design:<br /><br />Participants were split into two conditions and give a verbal memory task. In condition 1, 12 participants were told to use the counting mnemonic to remember the words. It was not known whether English was all the participants' first language, and this may have had some bearing on how quickly they performed the task. In condition 2, 12 participants used the loci mnemonic. One participant spoke aloud, although he had been instructed to memorize the given words in silence. The dependent measure was the number of correctly recalled words. <br /></font>

        ANSWER: We don't need the name of the mnemonics; in the design sub-section, it's enough to know that mnemonics were used.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Details are the meat of the design sub-section.  We do need the names of the mnemonics.
        ANSWER: We don't need any speculation, e.g. about first languages.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Speculation - i.e. whether participants' first language affected the results - should be found in the Discussion section.  The Discussion section comes after the Results section of a mini-project.

        FEEDBACK: Crucial information is missing here:  how long is the text?  What are the variables?  This is not a good choice.
        ANSWER: In a correlation designed experiment, participants were asked to score out all the instance of the letter 'e' in a short Harry Potter text.  The independent variable was the anxiety level of each participant.   There were three who scored highly on an anxiety ratio and two whose scores were much lower.  There were five dependent variables: the prediction of time taken to complete the task; the actual time taken to compete the task; the difference between the actual and predicted time; the prediction of instances of the letter 'e'; and the difference between the prediction and the actual number of e's.  
        FEEDBACK: This choice includes some information that is misplaced:  the anxiety scores should be in the Results section.  Not the best choice for the Design sub-section of the Method section.
        ANSWER: In a correlation designed experiment, participants were asked to score out all the instance of the letter 'e' in a short Harry Potter text.  The independent variable was the anxiety level of each participant.   There were five dependent variables: the prediction of time taken to complete the task; the actual time taken to compete the task; the difference between the actual and predicted time; the prediction of instances of the letter 'e'; and the difference between the prediction and the actual number of e's.
        FEEDBACK: This paragraph is full of information, but apropos the Harry Potter text, how short is short?  This kind of information would be crucial if the test were to be replicated.  Not the best choice.
        ANSWER: In a correlation designed experiment, participants were asked to score out all the instance of the letter 'e' in a 552 word text taken from the first page of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.   The independent variable was the anxiety level of each participant.  There were five dependent variables: the prediction of time taken to complete the task; the actual time taken to compete the task; the difference between the actual and predicted time; the prediction of instances of the letter 'e'; and the difference between the prediction and the actual number of e's.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is the best choice.  We have lots of information here, all of it relevant to the design of the experiment.  Incidentally, the Harry Potter book title should be italicised (see section of this site on italics), but this computer programme won't allow it!

    QUESTION 0 What should the first sentence of your Results section contain?
        ANSWER: An outline of the raw statistics.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: The inferential statistics.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: A restatement of the hypothesis/es.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is extremely helpful to the reader.
        ANSWER: A summary of the results, which will then be expanded.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
    QUESTION 1 What is the second step to take in your Results section?
        ANSWER: A summary of the results, for future expansion.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: An account of how you have treated the raw data.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  You need to give an overview not, I repeat NOT, of the raw data itself, but of how it was prepared for analysis, e.g. if a total score was used, if a partial score was used, if some data was discarded altogether.
        ANSWER: A description of the raw data.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Raw data goes should be placed in an Appendix.  There's a difference between presenting raw data (e.g. the individual scores for each participant) and describing how the raw data has been treated (e.g. if the total number of questions answered by participants have been included, or only some; whether all scores below 5 were discarded).
    QUESTION 2 Should the Results section be written in bullet points or continuous prose?
        ANSWER: Continuous prose.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  You may want to use bullet points within your prose, but the Results section should be a passage of text, plus clearly labelled graphs and tables if appropriate.
        ANSWER: Bullet points.
        FEEDBACK: That's incorrect.  You may want to use bullet points within your prose, but the Results section should be a passage of text, plus clearly labelled graphs and tables if appropriate.

    QUESTION 0 Is this t-test report complete?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  There's quite a lot missing.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  There's quite a lot missing.
    QUESTION 1 If you think things are missing, from the list below, choose what those things are.  You can choose more than one from the list.
        ANSWER: The acronym for 'aspirational social comparison'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  When we see ASC later in the text, it's not clear what this is.
        ANSWER: The total number of participants in the experiment.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  That number should come in the Participants sub-section of the Method section.
        ANSWER: The data, e.g. (M=47, SD=3.2) before 'males scored higher than females'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This is the Results section.  We need hard data.
        ANSWER: The data for the females.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It would look very odd to give only the male data.
        ANSWER: A quick overview of what ASC is.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This should have been included in, as appropriate, either your introduction or your Method section.  The Results section should only contain results.
        ANSWER: The result of the t-test in the correct format, e.g. t(38)=6.8, p<.05'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  We need to see the report of the t-test in the correct format.
    QUESTION 2 Is there anything else missing?
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Read the text carefully again.
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This independent t-test is two-tailed, i.e. it relates to distributions other than the normal.

    QUESTION 0 Does sentence 1 describe a table or a figure?
        ANSWER: Table.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. 
        ANSWER: Figure.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  A figure refers to graphs, maps, diagrams, photographs or pie-charts.  A table is set out in appropriately headed rows and columns, with the whole thing clearly labelled.
    QUESTION 1 Should figures and tables be numbered as well as labelled?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's right.  Figures and tables are numbered sequentially.  Since they are different ways of presenting data, their numerical sequence should be kept separate:  i.e. Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, Figure 2.  
        ANSWER: No.  You can choose either a label or a figure.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Figures and tables are numbered and labelled.  The number sequences for each should be kept separate:  i.e. Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, Figure 2.
    QUESTION 2 Do tables supplement or duplicate the text?
        ANSWER: Supplement.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  If you find yourself simply repeating, in the text, all the information to be found in the table, ask yourself if the table is really necessary.  A table should provide detailed information not provided in the text.  The text refers to the table:  it does not repeat the information.
        ANSWER: Duplicate:  i.e. they provide the same information but in a different form.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  If you find yourself simply repeating, in the text, all the information to be found in the table, ask yourself if the table is really necessary.  A table should provide detailed information not provided in the text.  The text refers to the table: it does not repeat the information.

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think this is too general.  It doesn't tell us what the data represents, e.g. exam scores or anxiety levels, etc.  A label needs to be more specific.
        ANSWER: Average performance of boys in 6th Year studying History, Maths and Psychology in preliminary examinations (prelims) conducted three months prior to the exam date.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is too detailed.  The headings within the Table will provide much of this information.  A label needs to provide a clear, concise overview.
        ANSWER: Average performance scores of 6th year boys in prelims.

    QUESTION 0 This type of figure displays the relationship between two quantitative indices or between a continuous quantitative variable (usually displayed as the y axis) and groups of subjects displayed along the x axis.  Is the figure a graph or a chart?
        ANSWER: Graph.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.
        ANSWER: Chart.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  A chart generally displays nonquantitative information, such as the flow of subjects through a process, e.g. flow charts.
    QUESTION 1 What do we call a figure that displays spatial information?
        ANSWER: A drawing.

INTRO 1. Perceptions of time have become far more sophisticated since the advent of time-tracking mechanisms.<br /><br />2. Anxiety appears to affect people's estimation as to how long certain tasks will take (Kelly, 2002).<br /><br />3. Kelly based his experiment on reading, but this was too subjective since people's understanding of how they were supposed to read, i.e. skim reading or full comprehension, was not specified.<br /><br />4. We decided to conduct a much more objective experiment, one that did not have an effect on the actual times observed. Instead of reading the passage, we will have the participants cross out the letter e so that individual differences are removed and the subjects' estimations are comparable. <br /><br />5. The prediction was that, supporting Kelly, the more anxious students were, the longer they thought the task would take. <br />

        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  You need something about the method in the abstract.  The problem with this passage is the style.
    QUESTION 4 Read passage 4 again.  What might you change?
        ANSWER: The verb tenses.  The future tense is incorrect, since an abstract is an overview of an experiment that has already been conducted.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  This passage mixes up verb tenses.  It would read far better if everything was written in the past tense.
        ANSWER: I wouldn't put in any of the details of the experiment itself.  It's enough to say that the experiment conducted for this mini-project was more objective.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think we need the details.
        ANSWER: I'd make it more impersonal, i.e. change the 'we' to 'this experiment ...' or 'this project ...'
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Substituting 'the experiment' or 'this project' would make the text more appropriately formal.
    QUESTION 5 Would sentence 5 be appropriate as the final sentence of the abstract?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Sentence 5 is a hypothesis and the abstract needs to finish with a result.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Sentence 5 is a hypothesis and the abstract needs to finish with a result.

INTRO Mini-project title:<br /><br />Is it possible to induce grapheme-colour synaestesia in non-synaesthetes?<br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Which is the best first line for the abstract that follows this title?
        ANSWER: Synaesthetes experience multiple senses at once, and this condition affects from 1 in 200 to 1 in 100,000 of the population, with women, particularly left-handed women, more likely to suffer than men (website 1).
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This is a general introduction to synaesthesia, and the mini-project is focusing on grapheme-colour synaesthesia.  As it's possible to explain grapheme-coloured synaesthesia without going back to basic synaesthesia, it's best to start with a sentence clearly focused on the mini-project.
        ANSWER: Is it possible to induce grapheme-coloured synaesthesia in non-synaesthetes?  This study aims to find out.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This opening reads a little like the opening gambit of a television programme!  Every sentence you write must add something essential to your work, and this adds nothing. 
        ANSWER: To find out if it was possible to induce grapheme-coloured synaesthesia in non-synaesthetes, this study took 15 students from Glasgow university, aged between 19 and 43.
        FEEDBACK: The information about method (the test participants) is fine for the abstract, but should come after a one sentence introduction so that the reader is familiar with the study focus.

    QUESTION 0 Which is the best closing line for the abstract following this title?
        ANSWER: This study will look at two scales:  the Anthropomorphism Scale Interview;  and the Belief in Paranormal Scale.
        FEEDBACK: An abstract should give an overview of a whole mini-project report.  It is not an introduction.  This is not the best choice.
        ANSWER: The relationship between paranormal beliefs and anthropomorphism in pets is complicated, and given the nature of the relationship, however many experiments are conducted, is likely to remain so.
        FEEDBACK: This reads more like the closing line of an essay than the abstract of a mini-project report.  Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: The study found no significant correlation between the anthropomorphism scale and paranormal scale, although two significant findings emerged:  pet-owners scored significantly higher than non pet-owners on the anthropomorphism scale and females scored significantly higher on the paranormal scale.
        FEEDBACK: To be perfect, the implications of these results should be described in a sentence, but of the options here, this is the best.  After reading the abstract, the reader should know what the results of the study were.

    QUESTION 0 Which is the best opening line for the abstract that follows this title?
        ANSWER: In order to engage in the social world, humans need to understand and predict the actions of others.
        FEEDBACK: This is too general an opening for the abstract.  It might, however, be a good opening for the introduction.  Remember, the abstract will be limited to around 150 words, so needs to get to the heart of the mini-project right from the start.  Not the best choice.
        ANSWER: This study investigated whether posture would affect the Body Gestalt effect in imitation.
        FEEDBACK: Repeating the title is always a waste of words.  Not the best option.
        ANSWER: Matching knowledge of our own body with the perception of others' bodies is both key to human engagement in the social world and a fundamental precept of Gestalt therapy.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line approaches this complicated topic directly and simply.  It helps us understand what the topic is.  This is the best option.

INTRO <font size="4">To conclude, the results of this study indicate a number of relationships. First, a significant positive correlation between anthropomorphism and paranormal belief scales was found, although only partial support for pet ownership having a significant effect. A significant difference does exist between the anthropomorphic tendency scores of non pet-owners and pet-owners, with pet-owners scoring significantly higher. However, the difference between non pet-owners and pet-owners in paranormal belief scores is non-significant.<br /><br />A number of design faults were noted during the running of this experiment:<br /></font>
<ul>
  <li><font size="4">participants missed out questions</font></li>
  <li><font size="4">no research was done into the order of the questions (e.g. some questions may have been 'leading')</font></li>
  <li><font size="4">participants were not screened for pre-existing beliefs</font></li>
</ul><font size="4"><br /><br />Future research should concentrate on rectifying design problems. In addition, the anthropomorphic scale used in this study was far from ideal, since it measure how valuable a pet was as a family member rather than the attribution of human characteristics.<br /></font>

        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The discussion should be a really interesting part of your mini-project.  Not quite the case here.
    QUESTION 1 What is wrong with the first paragraph?  You can choose more than one item.
        ANSWER: Nothing.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Try again.
        ANSWER: It's just a repeat of the results.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It repeats the results without either discussing them or relating them to the hypothesis/es.  
        ANSWER: It should begin by stating the hypothesis.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  A RESTATEMENT of the hypothesis should be made at the beginning of the Results section.  What we should be told is whether the results SUPPORT` or DON'T SUPPORT the hypothesis/es.
        ANSWER: There's no mention of other research.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Part of the discussion is to relate your experiment to other research findings and theoretical models.  Questions to be asked include:  do my findings agree or disagree with published research? If there are major differences, how can this be explained?
    QUESTION 2 Should the second item - design faults - be displayed in bullet points?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The discussion should be written in continuous prose.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The discussion should be presented in continuous prose.
    QUESTION 3 How would you describe the third paragraph, which concentrates on future research? 
        ANSWER: Comprehensive.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think there's lots more to say.
        ANSWER: Precise.
        FEEDBACK: It is precise, but is it interesting?
        ANSWER: Unimaginative.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It's too easy just to say 'tighten up the method'.  Whilst some methodological errors only come to light once the experiment has begun, others - in this case, the unsatisfactory nature of on of the marking scales - could have been forseen.   This type of discussion might well bring your mark down.
        ANSWER: Adequate.
        FEEDBACK: I don't agree.  The passage doesn't really discuss, it just makes some statements.

All the examples have explanations, so it's worth scrolling through them all even if your first selection agrees with ours.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the text, then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: Time estimation, and the effects of anxiety on it, is an interesting area of study.
        FEEDBACK: This is a superfluous sentence.  It adds nothing to the Discussion section.  There's no need for the kind of introduction this is clearly intended to be.  Not the best option.
        ANSWER: Over-estimation of time was linked to exam-related anxiety in 90% of our study participants, a finding that supported our hypothesis that time estimation and exam-related anxiety are related. 
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear statement of results, and linked straight to the hypothesis.  A good opening to the Discussion section.
        ANSWER: There are many theories and observations on the possible determinants of exam-related anxiety, Moneta and Spada cited motivational factors in their 2009 study.
        FEEDBACK: It's good to have a reference, but this opening of the Discussion section reads more like a general introduction, so is not the best choice.  The reference should be directly linked to your hypothesis and results, e.g. This study's results suggest that exam-related anxiety is associated with motivation, which supports the findings of Moneta and Spada's 2009 study.

    QUESTION 0 Which of the following options are the best concluding lines for the Discussion section?  All the options have explanations, so even if you agree with us first time, it's worth scrolling through them all.
        ANSWER: Suggestions for further research should include further analysis of Block B, to test whether information from the face is used in the Body Gestalt, or only information from the hands.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good concluding line, which suggests ways of furthering research rather than just correcting faults in the mini-project methodology.  The best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: This study was limited to 11 participants and this might have had significant effects on the results.  More participants would give more accurate results.
        FEEDBACK: This is an old stand-by!  In nearly all samples, larger studies would be better.  We're looking for something a little more imaginative.  
        ANSWER: The Body Gestalt is a vital area of study, since understanding and predicting the actions of others greatly impacts on societal cohesion.  Further work can only be welcome.
        FEEDBACK: These lines read more like the end of an essay than the end of the Discussion section of a mini-project.  The same style does not work for everything.   The end of the Discussion section of a mini-project needs to be factual and precise.  This is not the best choice.

INTRO  <font size="4">Mini-project title<br /><br />Rain as a catalyst for depression</font><br /><br /><font size="2">(The example has been adapted. Don't quote it.)</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Which of the following options best links the mini-project to previous research and theories?  
        ANSWER: Our findings support the findings of Grant (2010), who found that rain and depression are causally linked.  Our findings do not support Smith (2010) that rain and depression appear to be causally linked but this is only perception, not fact. 
        FEEDBACK: It is not enough just to say that the mini-project supports or does not support other studies.  You must say why or why not, e.g. Our hypothesis supports Grant (2010), by showing that during long periods of rain, levels of depression increase in men who work outside as well as in women who work in offices. 
        ANSWER: Our results show that depression amongst women working in offices is linked to rain, thus expanding on Grant (2010), who found that rain increased levels of depression in men working outside.  However, Grant's study was limited to men over 45, and age is also a factor in depression (Prince et al., 1997).
        FEEDBACK: Here, the mini-project's findings and other research are well linked, with reasons given.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: Our study supported Grant (2010) but was not truly comparable because we did not ask the gender or age of participants.
        FEEDBACK: This more or less says that your study is worthless.  Not a good thing to say!  If you are aware of design flaws, making the flaws the focus of your discussion will not help.  Find some way round the flaws.  For example, research different studies.  Always make sure that your Discussion section is valuable, even if it doesn't have quite the value you hoped.

INTRO Discussion<br /><br />This study supports the hypothesis that perceptions of adulthood are directly linked to perceptions of responsibility (68% of teenagers; 69% of people in their 20s; 90% of people in mid-life). The study was divided equally by gender, with 30 male participants and 30 female, and the participants came from a wide variety of different backgrounds and cultures, so the findings seem robust.<br /> 
    QUESTION 0 There is a clear error in this Discussion section.  What is it?
        ANSWER: 'Robust' is an inappropriate word.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  If your findings are clear and you feel your method is rock solid, then 'robust' seems a very appropriate word.
        ANSWER: Statements should be made about the results, but figures should not be included. 
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It's enough to say that your findings support your hypothesis.  You should discuss the meaning of your results, but not repeat your results. 
        ANSWER: A Discussion section should start with a more general sentence, leading in to the hypothesis.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree. By the time we've reached the Discussion section, the reader will be familiar with the focus of the project.  No introduction is needed.

        FEEDBACK: Grand flourishes are really for essays.
        ANSWER: With a restatement of your main findings and important points raised.

        ANSWER: The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1921 as a direct result of a collapse in production following an international war and a internal revolution.  The reasons for its abandonment are more complex, but an analysis of these reasons shows not just why the NEP lasted only seven years, but also how its own structure meant that failure in the long term was inevitable.

        ANSWER: Throughout history, nations have faced challenges in public health, but it is only within the last three hundred years that public health has become an issue of real concern.  In 14th century, for example, people were certainly worried about catching the plague and some containment policies were put in place.  However,  you could hardly call this a start to overcoming public health challenges.
        FEEDBACK: These lines tell us something, but they don't get straight into the question.  In an academic essay in Social and Political Science, you should not waste time on a potted history unless it's a necessary part of the answer to the essay question.  This is not the best option on offer here.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Essay question:<br /><br /></font>How, in some European societies, did World War I create favourable preconditions for the emergence of Fascist parties?<br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: There is a general consensus amongst those who study World War 1 that it left a lasting impact on world politics.  It was, after all, the Great War; the War to End All Wars.  Ten million men lost their lives and it is generally agreed that the world was never the same again.
        FEEDBACK: These lines start well, but the second line begins to drift.  Make sure you stick firmly to the question in your opening lines.  First impressions are very important.
        ANSWER: Three conditions are necessary for the emergence of fascism: nationalist ideology; a charismatic leader and a political environment which provides democratic legitimacy.  By looking closely at the legacy of World War I, it is possible to identify certain preconditions which gave birth to these conditions, and this essay will explore these preconditions with particular reference to Germany and Spain.
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear and confident start.  The reader learns something important from the first sentence, and the second sentence provides an essay map.   These lines are the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: World War I (1914-1918) was a conflict caused by a number of factors, but the immediate catalyst was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by a Serb.  This assassination set in motion a war of mass carnage, which dragged on until finally ending with Germany's humiliation at the Treaty of Versailles.
        FEEDBACK: Nothing here is wrong - except that by the end of these lines a reader who had not seen the question would have no idea what the essay was supposed to be about.  There is no mention of fascism.  Every fact in your first lines must be relevant to the essay question.  However well written they are, if your first lines are just a wander through history, they'll gain you no marks.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Is fascism necessarily anti-Christian?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: It is clear, then, that one of fascism's most devious strengths is its principle of adapting and gathering   to itself other creeds, even ones seemingly inimical to its beliefs. Fascism is, therefore, not necessarily anti-Christian because it is not, by necessity, anti anything at all.
        FEEDBACK: These are strong closing lines that come to a thought-provoking conclusion.  These are the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Unfortunately, as this essay has proven, we do not as yet fully understand the relationship between fascism and Christianity.
        FEEDBACK: The statement made by these concluding lines may be true but the lines leave the reader with a sense of anti-climax.  The essay question asked for an answer.  If there is no answer, try not to finish your essay with a sentence beginning 'unfortunately', since this leaves a clear impression of defeat.  These lines are not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: In addition, we might remember that the term 'clerical-fascism' is an oxymoron, which leaves us with the question:  were these Catholic states fascist at all?
        FEEDBACK: Rhetorical questions are not good ways to finish an essay.  Rhetorical question smack of journalism, not academia.  These lines are not the best choice here.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Why was there famine in Ireland but not in Scotland in the 1840s?<br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: As has been seen, diversity of crops, a more prosperous economy and famine relief schemes were key to Scotland avoiding famine in the 1840s. In Ireland, failure to address any of these issues in time meant that famine was an inevitable result of potato blight.  When combined with the policies of the British government, mass starvation was unavoidable.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines briefly recapitulate the themes of the essay in order to give a satisfactory answer to the essay question. These are the best lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: There were also other causes of the famine, for example landlords mismanaging their lands, but these do not truly account for the differences in the effects of famine between Scotland and Ireland.
        FEEDBACK: These lines rather drift to a halt, and it is always a mistake to bring in new ideas right at the end of an essay.  If there are topics you cannot include for space reasons, but you want to make reference to them, the introduction is the right place to mention them, not the conclusion.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: It was a truly terrible time for the Irish and the British government should apologise and hang its head in shame.
        FEEDBACK: You may think this, but an academic essay is not the place to air such views unless specifically asked to do so by the essay question.  Not the best choice here.

        ANSWER: Housing policy plays an important role in people's mental health and so policies should be put in place that reflect this.
        FEEDBACK: Be careful of the question:  this one asks specifically about physical health.  Make sure your conclusion fits with the essay question.   Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Where you live is quite important and people in charge of housing policy have a duty to remember this.
        FEEDBACK: Apart from the colloquialism (what does 'quite' really mean?), this concluding line is fine, if a little uninspiring.  It's not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: As has been demonstrated, a three-pronged approach to health through public policy has dramatic effects.  Housing is a key part of this approach and if anybody queries the reason why housing policy should always seek to make a contribution towards improving people's physical health, the answer is simple: the contribution actually works.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines have a good ring to them.  Confident and focussed, they leave a good impression.  These lines are the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Poland's not out of the woods yet. 
        FEEDBACK: The expression 'out of the woods' make this concluding line too colloquial for an academic essay.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Until Poland's organs of regional government achieve independence from central government, further development is not possible.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good, solid concluding line because it leaves the reader with something to think about and a sense of closure.  This line is the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: As has been shown, it is difficult to assess exactly why it has been so difficult for Poland to implement a coherent regional policy.  Perhaps things will be clearer in a few more years.
        FEEDBACK: These are unsatisfactory concluding lines.  Even if a definitive answer is not possible, some conclusions should be drawn.  Not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: I think that ethnographers' biggest limitation is understanding other cultures.
        FEEDBACK: This line is too personal (avoid 'I think') and although it makes a statement, feels rather flat.  Not the best option here. 
        ANSWER: The possible limits of anthropological engagement with different cultures and societies?  Understanding.
        FEEDBACK: Including a rhetorical question in your concluding lines smacks of journalism rather than academia.  If you have a statement to make, make it.  Avoid the rhetorical question.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: From all the examples given, one thing is clear:  ethnographers' biggest limitation is not one of engagement with different cultures and societies but one of understanding, and whether it is possible to break through this barrier is highly doubtful.
        FEEDBACK: This is an example of a good concluding line: it does not provide a definitive answer but still says something definite, i.e. that engagement is limited by understanding.  This answers the question set in the essay title and leaves the reader with something positive to think about.  It is the best option here.

We're left asking 'what is leading to etc.'  This sub-clause does contain a verb - 'delivers' - but this verb is attached  something within the sub-clause.

        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is a complete sentence. Sentence 2 is the fragment.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  The subject of sentence 1 is 'the main way' not 'Labour', so 'the main way' needs a verb of its own, e.g. 'The main way Labour managed to reduce child poverty WAS with its tax and benefit system.'

        ANSWER: The concept of globalisation is complex.  It does not simply mean that the world is one marketplace.
        FEEDBACK: If you have taken the phrase 'one marketplace' from a source, you must acknowledge that source.  If, however, this idea is your own thought, you don't need hard evidence here since this is your opinion.  You will, though, want to prove your point and this will usually involve examples.
        ANSWER: Globalisation has brought with it a new kind of crime, in which international financial institutions are charged with not supporting poor nations to uphold, for example, globally accepted safety standards.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion does need evidence. Appropriate evidence might include the 2002 sinking of the Senegalese ferry, as analysed by Rothe, Muzzatti and Mullins (2006).  
        ANSWER: The western media, with its wide reach, contributes to the sense that we are all connected.
        FEEDBACK: Although telling examples are always helpful, this kind of general assertion does not need specific evidence.  However, if you are paraphrasing lines you found in a source, you must acknowledge the source both in the text and in the bibliography.

        ANSWER: Illegal arms trafficking compromises public safety.
        FEEDBACK: This general assertion is a topic for a paragraph (which would include examples) rather than something that requires immediate hard evidence.
        ANSWER: In 2001, the Serbian authorities found huge amounts of pure heroin in a bank deposit box.
        FEEDBACK: This type of statement is never acceptable in an academic essay.  How much is 'huge'?  We need to know that 600 kg of 93% pure heroin was discovered, with a street value of about $20 million - and this must be properly referenced.

        FEEDBACK: Evidence is certainly needed here, for example '... walking trips to the main food store increased from 12.3% to 30.8% after retail intervention (Wrigley et al. 2004)'.
        ANSWER: A 'food desert' intervention study in Leeds included focus groups as a major part of its design.
        FEEDBACK: This statement does not need specific evidence, although we need a reference for the study, e.g. (Wrigley et al. 2004).  It is highly likely that evidence from the focus groups would be included in the essay.
        ANSWER: Tesco is increasing its market share as Morrison's share is slipping.

        FEEDBACK: This is a topic sentence, but does not require hard evidence in the same way as, for example, a statement about how many people died in the famine.
        ANSWER: Before famine struck, adult males in Ireland consumed massive numbers of potatoes each day.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention numbers, you must give numbers, not rely on colloquialisms like 'massive'.  A better sentence would be: Before famine struck adult males in Ireland consumed on average 70 potatoes each day. <br />
        ANSWER: In conclusion, it is clear that these are the reasons Scotland avoided the famine which was so disastrous for their neighbours across the Irish sea.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.
        FEEDBACK: The phrase 'found many ways' clearly indicates a need for evidence.  You cannot say 'many ways' and not produce at least two fully referenced examples of those ways.  You might, for example, say:  Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.  For example, she undermined relations between cabinet colleagues and appropriated the powers of her Chancellor of the Exchequer (Smith in Rhodes & Dunleavy 1995).
        ANSWER: Thatcher became the British prime minister following the 1979 general election.
        FEEDBACK: This is a well known and incontrovertible fact so doesn't need proof.
        ANSWER: In 1979, there was a big percentage swing to the Conservatives and they won many more seats than Labour.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention percentages and numbers, you need to provide exact figures, not just concepts like 'big' or 'more'.  Here, we need to know that the percentage swing was 5.2% and that the Conservatives won 339 seats against Labour's 269 (BBC 1997).

        ANSWER: Yes.

In this case, a new topic has been introduced.  Topic 1 is the effects of Fascism.  Topic 2 concerns historians.  I think these sentences would be better separated by a full stop.

        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The list of names here flows into the sentence.  A list is not flagged up by stating a number.  There's no need for any punctuation before 'Durkheim'.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  In this sentence, a list is flagged up by stating a number - 'will examine three etc.  In sentence 1, where a number is not flagged up, the names flow into the sentence.
        ANSWER: Neither.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />What can the literature on fundamentalism and creationism tell us about the problems of modern society?</font><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the text then answer the question(s).</font> 
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism and creationism fundamentally reject the modern world, and this rejection in itself describes one major problem of the modern world:  a sense of alienation.  This sense is witnessed by ...
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines fulfil one of the major criteria of a good opening line:  they grab the author's attention.  I like the fact that we're also to get an example early on.  A powerful opening and the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Modern society has many problems and the literature on fundamentalism and creationism tells us a great deal about those problems.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the question.  It tells us nothing.  Nor does it open the essay up.  We wouldn't miss this line if it was removed from the essay.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Fundamentalism is 'strict adherence to a specific set of theological doctrines typically in reaction against the theology of Modernism' (Wikipedia 2011).
        FEEDBACK: Although beginning your essay with a defining quotation is a good technique, wikipedia is not a reliable source of information.  For this reason, this is a poor choice.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Why was the New Economic Policy (NEP) adopted in 1921 but then abandoned only seven years later?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        ANSWER: This essay will assess the reasons for the rise and fall of the New Economic Policy (NEP) which was adopted in 1921 only to be abandoned seven years later.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line simply repeats the terms of the question.  Nothing is added and it does not open up the essay in any way.  If you removed this line, the essay would be none the poorer.  A poor choice.
        ANSWER: Marx and Engels both saw communism as a logical step in societal evolution but if communism was the next step forward from industrial capitalism, then Russia would not have been either Marx or Engels' choice for the experiment.  As they ask in the preface to the 1882 edition of the Communist Manifesto ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines are informative but opening lines need to seize the essay question directly.  All this information may be useful within the essay, but as opening lines these are unhelpful.
        ANSWER: The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1921 as a direct result of a collapse in production following an international war and a internal revolution.  The reasons for its abandonment are more complex, but an analysis of these reasons shows not just why the NEP lasted only seven years, but also how its own structure meant that failure in the long term was inevitable.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines address the question directly.  They add information and they open up the question in an interesting way.  These lines are the best choice.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Throughout the ages, women have been seen as the 'weaker' sex.  In ancient Greece, for example, long hailed as an example of democracy, women were not seen as equal to men.
        FEEDBACK: These opening lines are much too general.  They might do for an article in a tabloid newspaper but simply waste words in an academic essay.  In an academic essay, you need to seize the subject from the very start. Not a good choice.
        ANSWER: That any public policy in 21st century should have to address specifically the needs of women shows that public policy directed at women's equality has been ineffective.  However, this may be more to do with women's expectations than public policy failure.  For example, ...
        FEEDBACK: These lines certainly grab the reader's attention.  Confident and controversial, they would make any reader want to read on.  The best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Women have a pretty rough ride as I know from experience.  In 2010, my mother is still not being paid the same as her male counterparts.  Public policy is pretty ineffective if it cannot even guarantee the same wage for the same job.
        FEEDBACK: These lines are too anecdotal and colloquial.   With a few tweaks - for example using the experience of the writer's mother in a more objective way, with hard evidence attached - they could be transformed into lines suitable for an academic essay.  As they stand, however, these lines are not the best choice here.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />What were the main challenges facing public health in the 19th century and how were these challenges overcome?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Urbanisation, attitudes towards health, poor diet, poor housing and environmental degradation were all challenges to public health in the 19th century.
        FEEDBACK: This opening line gets straight to the point.  The best option here.
        ANSWER: During the 19th century, many things changed in Britain and across the whole of Europe.  
        FEEDBACK: This sentence adds nothing to the essay, simply repeating the terms of the question.  We wouldn't miss this opening line if it were deleted.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Throughout history, nations have faced challenges in public health, but it is only within the last three hundred years that public health has become an issue of real concern.  In 14th century, for example, people were certainly worried about catching the plague and some containment policies were put in place.  However,  you could hardly call this a start to overcoming public health challenges.
        FEEDBACK: These lines tell us something, but they don't get straight into the question.  In an academic essay in Social and Political Science, you should not waste time on a potted history unless it's a necessary part of the answer to the essay question.  This is not the best option on offer here.

INTRO <font size="4" style="font-weight: bold;">Essay question:<br /><br /></font>How, in some European societies, did World War I create favourable preconditions for the emergence of Fascist parties?<br /> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the opening lines. Which opening lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: There is a general consensus amongst those who study World War 1 that it left a lasting impact on world politics.  It was, after all, the Great War; the War to End All Wars.  Ten million men lost their lives and it is generally agreed that the world was never the same again.
        FEEDBACK: These lines start well, but the second line begins to drift.  Make sure you stick firmly to the question in your opening lines.  First impressions are very important.
        ANSWER: Three conditions are necessary for the emergence of fascism: nationalist ideology; a charismatic leader and a political environment which provides democratic legitimacy.  By looking closely at the legacy of World War I, it is possible to identify certain preconditions which gave birth to these conditions, and this essay will explore these preconditions with particular reference to Germany and Spain.
        FEEDBACK: This is a clear and confident start.  The reader learns something important from the first sentence, and the second sentence provides an essay map.   These lines are the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: World War I (1914-1918) was a conflict caused by a number of factors, but the immediate catalyst was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife by a Serb.  This assassination set in motion a war of mass carnage, which dragged on until finally ending with Germany's humiliation at the Treaty of Versailles.
        FEEDBACK: Nothing here is wrong - except that by the end of these lines a reader who had not seen the question would have no idea what the essay was supposed to be about.  There is no mention of fascism.  Every fact in your first lines must be relevant to the essay question.  However well written they are, if your first lines are just a wander through history, they'll gain you no marks.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title:<br /><br />Is fascism necessarily anti-Christian?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: It is clear, then, that one of fascism's most devious strengths is its principle of adapting and gathering   to itself other creeds, even ones seemingly inimical to its beliefs. Fascism is, therefore, not necessarily anti-Christian because it is not, by necessity, anti anything at all.
        FEEDBACK: These are strong closing lines that come to a thought-provoking conclusion.  These are the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: Unfortunately, as this essay has proven, we do not as yet fully understand the relationship between fascism and Christianity.
        FEEDBACK: The statement made by these concluding lines may be true but the lines leave the reader with a sense of anti-climax.  The essay question asked for an answer.  If there is no answer, try not to finish your essay with a sentence beginning 'unfortunately', since this leaves a clear impression of defeat.  These lines are not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: In addition, we might remember that the term 'clerical-fascism' is an oxymoron, which leaves us with the question:  were these Catholic states fascist at all?
        FEEDBACK: Rhetorical questions are not good ways to finish an essay.  Rhetorical question smack of journalism, not academia.  These lines are not the best choice here.

INTRO <font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Essay title:</span><br /><br />Why was there famine in Ireland but not in Scotland in the 1840s?<br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: As has been seen, diversity of crops, a more prosperous economy and famine relief schemes were key to Scotland avoiding famine in the 1840s. In Ireland, failure to address any of these issues in time meant that famine was an inevitable result of potato blight.  When combined with the policies of the British government, mass starvation was unavoidable.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines briefly recapitulate the themes of the essay in order to give a satisfactory answer to the essay question. These are the best lines on offer here.
        ANSWER: There were also other causes of the famine, for example landlords mismanaging their lands, but these do not truly account for the differences in the effects of famine between Scotland and Ireland.
        FEEDBACK: These lines rather drift to a halt, and it is always a mistake to bring in new ideas right at the end of an essay.  If there are topics you cannot include for space reasons, but you want to make reference to them, the introduction is the right place to mention them, not the conclusion.  Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: It was a truly terrible time for the Irish and the British government should apologise and hang its head in shame.
        FEEDBACK: You may think this, but an academic essay is not the place to air such views unless specifically asked to do so by the essay question.  Not the best choice here.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Which concluding lines are the best option? All the choices have explanations, so even if your first choice agrees with ours, it's worth clicking on all the options.</font> 
        ANSWER: Housing policy plays an important role in people's mental health and so policies should be put in place that reflect this.
        FEEDBACK: Be careful of the question:  this one asks specifically about physical health.  Make sure your conclusion fits with the essay question.   Not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: Where you live is quite important and people in charge of housing policy have a duty to remember this.
        FEEDBACK: Apart from the colloquialism (what does 'quite' really mean?), this concluding line is fine, if a little uninspiring.  It's not the best choice here.
        ANSWER: As has been demonstrated, a three-pronged approach to health through public policy has dramatic effects.  Housing is a key part of this approach and if anybody queries the reason why housing policy should always seek to make a contribution towards improving people's physical health, the answer is simple: the contribution actually works.
        FEEDBACK: These closing lines have a good ring to them.  Confident and focussed, they leave a good impression.  These lines are the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: Poland's not out of the woods yet. 
        FEEDBACK: The expression 'out of the woods' make this concluding line too colloquial for an academic essay.  Not the best choice on offer here.
        ANSWER: Until Poland's organs of regional government achieve independence from central government, further development is not possible.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good, solid concluding line because it leaves the reader with something to think about and a sense of closure.  This line is the best on offer here.
        ANSWER: As has been shown, it is difficult to assess exactly why it has been so difficult for Poland to implement a coherent regional policy.  Perhaps things will be clearer in a few more years.
        FEEDBACK: These are unsatisfactory concluding lines.  Even if a definitive answer is not possible, some conclusions should be drawn.  Not the best option on offer here.

        ANSWER: I think that ethnographers' biggest limitation is understanding other cultures.
        FEEDBACK: This line is too personal (avoid 'I think') and although it makes a statement, feels rather flat.  Not the best option here. 
        ANSWER: The possible limits of anthropological engagement with different cultures and societies?  Understanding.
        FEEDBACK: Including a rhetorical question in your concluding lines smacks of journalism rather than academia.  If you have a statement to make, make it.  Avoid the rhetorical question.  These lines are not the best option on offer here.
        ANSWER: From all the examples given, one thing is clear:  ethnographers' biggest limitation is not one of engagement with different cultures and societies but one of understanding, and whether it is possible to break through this barrier is highly doubtful.
        FEEDBACK: This is an example of a good concluding line: it does not provide a definitive answer but still says something definite, i.e. that engagement is limited by understanding.  This answers the question set in the essay title and leaves the reader with something positive to think about.  It is the best option here.

        ANSWER: Sentence 1 is a complete sentence. Sentence 2 is the fragment.

The subject of sentence 1 is 'the main way' not 'Labour', so 'the main way' needs a verb of its own, e.g. 'The main way Labour managed to reduce child poverty WAS with its tax and benefit system.'

        ANSWER: The concept of globalisation is complex.  It does not simply mean that the world is one marketplace.
        FEEDBACK: If you have taken the phrase 'one marketplace' from a source, you must acknowledge that source.  If, however, this idea is your own thought, you don't need hard evidence here since this is your opinion.  You will, though, want to prove your point and this will usually involve examples.
        ANSWER: Globalisation has brought with it a new kind of crime, in which international financial institutions are charged with not supporting poor nations to uphold, for example, globally accepted safety standards.
        FEEDBACK: This assertion does need evidence. Appropriate evidence might include the 2002 sinking of the Senegalese ferry, as analysed by Rothe, Muzzatti and Mullins (2006).  
        ANSWER: The western media, with its wide reach, contributes to the sense that we are all connected.
        FEEDBACK: Although telling examples are always helpful, this kind of general assertion does not need specific evidence.  However, if you are paraphrasing lines you found in a source, you must acknowledge the source both in the text and in the bibliography.

        FEEDBACK: This statement does not need specific evidence, although we need a reference for the study, e.g. (Wrigley et al. 2004).  It is highly likely that evidence from the focus groups would be included in the essay.
        ANSWER: Tesco is increasing its market share as Morrison's share is slipping.
        FEEDBACK: Assertions about figures and statistics always need hard evidence to back them up.  This assertion should be followed by:  According to Kantar Worldpanel (in Daily Telegraph 2010a) December 2010 saw Tesco's market share increase to 30.7% from 30.6% whilst Morrison's dipped from 12.1% to 12%.

        ANSWER: The Irish famine was precipitated by potato blight.
        FEEDBACK: This is a topic sentence, but does not require hard evidence in the same way as, for example, a statement about how many people died in the famine.
        ANSWER: Before famine struck, adult males in Ireland consumed massive numbers of potatoes each day.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention numbers, you must give numbers, not rely on colloquialisms like 'massive'.  A better sentence would be: Before famine struck adult males in Ireland consumed on average 70 potatoes each day. <br />
        ANSWER: In conclusion, it is clear that these are the reasons Scotland avoided the famine which was so disastrous for their neighbours across the Irish sea.

    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.
        FEEDBACK: The phrase 'found many ways' clearly indicates a need for evidence.  You cannot say 'many ways' and not produce at least two fully referenced examples of those ways.  You might, for example, say:  Thatcher found many ways of increasing her power within cabinet.  For example, she undermined relations between cabinet colleagues and appropriated the powers of her Chancellor of the Exchequer (Smith in Rhodes & Dunleavy 1995).
        ANSWER: Thatcher became the British prime minister following the 1979 general election.
        FEEDBACK: This is a well known and incontrovertible fact so doesn't need proof.
        ANSWER: In 1979, there was a big percentage swing to the Conservatives and they won many more seats than Labour.
        FEEDBACK: If you mention percentages and numbers, you need to provide exact figures, not just concepts like 'big' or 'more'.  Here, we need to know that the percentage swing was 5.2% and that the Conservatives won 339 seats against Labour's 269 (BBC 1997).

        ANSWER: A
        FEEDBACK: No, it's B.  The 'ing' ending to the verb is often a giveaway, since that style of verb is not a driving verb and every sentence needs a driving verb.
        ANSWER: B
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The clue is in the 'ing' ending to the verb, which means it is not a driving verb and a sentence needs a driving verb.
    QUESTION 1 Can you identify the driving verb in sentence A?
        ANSWER: strips
        FEEDBACK: No.  Strips is a noun, a naming word.
        ANSWER: different
        FEEDBACK: No.  Different is an adjective, a describing word.
        ANSWER: have
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Have is the driving verb.
    QUESTION 2 Which of the following options is the best way to get rid of the fragment?
        ANSWER: These strips have different polarities causing these different zones.
        FEEDBACK: The repetition of 'these' is clumsy.  This is not the best option.
        ANSWER: Causing these different zones, these strips have different polarities.

In 1859, Darwin published his theory of evolution based on the many fossil examples that had been recently found (Press et al. 2004). Fossils are accepted as providing definitive proof of the process of evolution (Benton et al, 2009) and can also help in the assessment of the relative ages of sedimentary rocks. This was a technique realised in 1793 by William Smith (Press et al. 2004). Palaeoecology developed from this science of palaeontology. <br /><br /></font>

        FEEDBACK: I wouldn't give it 5.  The essay title specifically asks for a general discussion on palaeoecology and this example starts with palaeontology, causing the reader to wonder if the writer has misread the question.   So, although background information on palaeontology is interesting, and is not entirely irrelevant, it is misplaced.  Your introduction needs to get straight to the point - a brief description of palaeoecology, followed by a list of the fossil groups you are going to include.  The broader discussion of palaeoecology (as requested in the essay title) would come in the paragraph following the introduction, and in that paragraph, the information provided (which is very well referenced) would be relevant.  So - placing of information is just as important as the information itself.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: What differences can we observe between oceanic plate separation and continental plate separation, and how do these movements fit into the theory of plate tectonics?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br /><br />The theory of plate tectonics suggests that the lithosphere, which is the outer shell of Earth that encases the asthenosphere and whose crust is rigid, is not one continuous shell, but is broken into plates (Grotzinger et al, 2007). These plates can be divided into continental plates: for example, the North American plate (although it should be noted that continental plates are not the same size and shape as the continent after which they are named); and oceanic plates, the largest of which is the Pacific plate. These plates move and separate, causing observable features. This essay will look first at the features caused by oceanic plate separation and then the features caused by continental plate separation, and relate both to the theory of plate tectonics. <br /><br /></font>

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Discuss the value of fossils in biostratigraphy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br /><br />Fossils, the remnants of plants or animals that lived in a different era, form the core of biostratigraphy, the discipline which dates rocks from these fossil fragments. The first person to really work on fossils was William Smith, who lived from 1769-1839. He was a canal engineer, and through his work he began to see that different fossils were embedded in different rocks. His fascination with the fossils led him to be labelled the &quot;Father of English Geology&quot; (Wikipedia). It was he who published the first geological map of Britain, which illustrated his realisation that you could use fossils &quot;to match rocks across regions&quot; (Wikipedia). This did not gain him recognition at first, and he ended up in the debtors' jail as people copied his map and sold it cheaply. In the end, however, he was recognised and now merits a place in all the textbooks.<br /></font>

It's good to mention William Smith, but you must relate his work to the essay title rather than go off on a tangent about his life.  Also, Wikipedia is not a good source of information for an academic essay.  Instead of a potted life of Smith, we need examples of groups of fossils to be discussed and a sentence telling us how the question of the value of the study of fossils will be addressed.  That would all be much more relevant.

Trilobites were one of the assemblages of fossils discovered by William Smith, known as the Father of British Geology, when he began to itemise fossil changes he found in rocks on a journey from Wales to London. He discovered that the marine Paleozoic was dominated by trilobites, as well as brachiopods and graptolites. The segments of the trilobite move, which allowed it to curl up against predators. Underneath the trilobite, each thoracic segment bears a pair of legs and gills, which shows some process of adaptation to life in the sea.<br /></font>

As has been shown in this essay, observations and analysis of the remains of trilobites, brachiopods and bivalve molluscs are particularly fruitful sources of study for palaeoecologists. However, although, as has been shown, some of the evidence provided by these fossil groups seems very clear, it should be remembered that much of what we know is still conjecture and that palaeoecologists of the future still have much to prove.<br /></font>

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Palaeoecology: Adaptations of Fossil Invertebrates to Life in the Sea.<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 
        ANSWER: From the study of the fossils of the three organisms discussed, we have a much clearer idea of their modes of life and environment.  However, though data obtained during palaeoecological study is of great value, its interpretation through the Principle of Uniformitarianism must be approached with care as many of the organisms that make up the assemblages (a single sample for a particular horizon) are not preserved.  This means that palaeoecology is an incomplete science and, as a result, our knowledge of the adaptation of fossil invertebrates to life in the sea is incomplete also.
        FEEDBACK: This is a good summary and conclusion.  It refers back to the essay and then makes a judgment.  The whole effect is to leave the reader satisfied.  
        ANSWER: So we can see that fossils can show us what life was like in the past and we need the science of palaeoecology to interpret the ancient marine environment, though this is incredibly difficult as most of the organisms they want to study are now extinct.  Still, we can still learn enough to be helpful to scientists both now and in the future.
        FEEDBACK: This is not a focused summary and conclusion, and is written in too chatty a style.  If you compare it with example 1, it seems very thin and insubstantial. 
        ANSWER: To conclude, "Fossil organisms provide fundamental evidence of evolution;  they also allow the reconstruction of ancient animal and plant communities" and 'evolutionary palaeoecology charts the changing structure and composition of palaeoecommunities through time" (Benton and Harper, 2009).  This is why palaeoecology is important, and how it is more than ever relevant today.
        FEEDBACK: Direct quotations of this length, even when properly referenced, are not acceptable in Earth Science essays.  You must write your own summary and conclusion.  Definitely the worst option here.

        FEEDBACK: This is short and snappy - a little too short and snappy.  To summarise a discussion, we need a brief mention of the topics or, in this case, organisms, discussed, and a rather more meaty conclusion than just a statement of the obvious (i.e. that fossils provide information). 1 out of 3.

        ANSWER: It is clear that plants and animals have a distinct relationship with their surrounding environments.  In order to survive, they have to adapt to pattern changes.
        FEEDBACK: This is a rather thin and abrupt summary and conclusion.  It does not remind us of the examples the writer used.  It could be the summary and conclusion to any essay.  Not the best choice.
        ANSWER: This essay has defined palaeoecology and, through trilobites, brachiopods and bivalves, described how the various morphological features we see preserved help us to understand both the habitats and the adaptations of these creatures to those habitats.  One of the values of this study is to show how the simplest organisms can survive catastrophic events, a subject on which much work remains to be done. 
        FEEDBACK: This is clear, concise and direct summary, listing exactly what the essay has done, and has a neat, forward looking conclusion.   This is the best option.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, the research that has gone into investigating the palaeoecology of invertebrates allows for a wider opinion to be consulted on what 'we' think the mode of life of these creatures truly was.  This allows room for lots of interpretation of the environment at the time these creatures lived.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is very vague and wanders about in an unformed way.  The quotation marks round 'we' are inappropriate, and the whole paragraph is sloppily put together.  Good summaries and conclusions are tightly written, with no wasted words.  This example is loose and would gain no marks.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the following essay title, then choose the best introduction from the selection offered.</font> 
        ANSWER: Life on Earth underwent radical change in the middle of the Palaeozoic period. Lots of new species appeared in the sea, including trilobites, eurypterid and other invertebrates.  These replace species that had disappeared at the end of the Ordovician.  This essay will look at three groups of invertebrates, starting with bivalve molluscs.
        FEEDBACK: The essay title specifically asks firstly for a general discussion on palaeoecology.  This has been ignored, which is not a good sign.  We also need a list of the invertebrates to be discussed.  It's not clear whether all those mentioned are going to be included.  Altogether, this is a muddling introduction for the reader and would not gain good marks.
        ANSWER: Palaeoecology, or the study of ancient organisms and their relationship with the environments in which they lived, creates a clear picture of the world's earliest ecosystems through fossil records.   This essay will describe and discuss the variety of ways ancient sea organisms lived, interacted and adapted to their environments, using as illustrations trilobites, brachiopods, bivalve molluscs and corals.   Finally, the essay will assess the broader value of palaeoecology in helping us to understand how creatures from the past survived catastrophic events that might have been expected to wipe them out. 
        FEEDBACK: This introduction is clear and directly relates to the essay title.  The definition of palaeoecology is neatly inserted into the first sentence, and a broader discussion signposted for the end.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: Shipman, P. (1981) describes palaeoecology as "the study of ancient ecosystems and the habits, lifestyles and interdependencies of the species in that ecosystem".  This defines palaeoecology as the study of ancient fossils in relation to their environments and how they lived thousands of years ago.  I shall discuss the palaeoecology of brachiopods, bivalve molluscs and corals.
        FEEDBACK: This introduction lists the creatures to be discussed, but the quotation at the start is wrongly inserted (see the section on 'excessive use of quotations' on this site) and there's not much point using a quote if you are then just going to repeat it in different words.   Despite the list, this is a poor option.

    QUESTION 0  <font size="4"><br /></font> 
        ANSWER: Volcanic activity, or volcanism, is the process by which new material is brought up to Earth's surface through vents known as volcanoes.  They are often found round the edges of tectonic plates and this essay is going to explore why this happens. 
        FEEDBACK: We need an introduction to plate tectonics rather than just a mention of tectonic plates. We also need a clearer idea of the topics the essay will address.  This is not the best option.
        ANSWER: Tectonic Plate theory is the study of the outer layers of Earth.  The plates are constantly moving in a complex cycle that is ongoing and unending.  Volcanic activity does various jobs to do with this process and this essay is going to talk about this.
        FEEDBACK: After a good opening sentence, this introduction collapses into meaningless generalities. The phrases 'ongoing and unending' and 'various jobs' tell us nothing.  A bad option.
        ANSWER: Volcanism plays a major role in the shaping of the world, and the unifying theory of plate tectonics, advanced in the 1960s, which outlines the movement of the various plates and the forces at work between them, revolutionised geological thinking, particularly with reference to volcanoes.  This paper will describe what the plates are, then look at three tectonic settings: mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones and within-plate magmatism.   Finally, it will describe the differing compositions of magma produced, since this also has a bearing on volcanic activity.

        ANSWER: In 1859, Darwin created his theory of evolution based upon the many fossil samples that had recently been found.  Fossils are accepted as providing definitive proof of the process of evolution.  There are approximately 200,000 fossil species currently known to palaeontologists (Brenchley et al. 1998), so there is much material available for those scientists who study prehistoric life.
        FEEDBACK: Everything stated in this introduction is true, but little of it is relevant to the essay title.  Beware of mistaking historical facts for scientific observations.
        ANSWER: Palaeoecology is really important for us nowadays because it predicts how our planet is evolving.  Earth is a huge organism that interacts with its environment:  the atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere.  Palaeoecology provides techniquest to determine how Earth's behaviour will change and how new challenges to Earth, such as the greenhouse effect, may change the world we live in.
        FEEDBACK: This introduction is not a good option.  Nothing in it is false, but nothing in it bears any relation to the essay title.  Never allow what you write to wander off the topic of the essay and onto another topic.
        ANSWER: Palaeoecology, which examines the sub-fossil remains of various organisms preserved in ocean sediments, reveals much about the physical modifications of fossil invertebrates as they adapted to life in the sea.  Through the study of three invertebrate groups - trilobites, brachiopods and bi-valve molluscs - much data has been gathered, although interpretation of that data is, as will be shown, still problematic.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these is the best introduction to the essay topic?  Rate them all out of 3, with 1 being the lowest and 3 the highest.
        ANSWER: Volcanism is an incredibly important process for Earth, bring to the crust an abundance of minerals less common elsewhere and creating new rocks and landmass, as well as totally changing the face of the old. There is great variability in both the kind of lava that erupts and the explosions caused, which is often determined by what is going on at the various tectonic settings.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree that this is the best.  Yes, there is mention of volcanoes and tectonic settings, but also of minerals, which seems out of place.  There is also no clear map of the assignment:  we have no idea what is going to be discussed (for example, mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones or within-plate magmatism).  In addition, there is no mention of plate tectonics, which is crucial.  So - 1 out of 3 here. 
        ANSWER: During the 20th century, cartographers charted the deep ocean trenches, seismologists plotted earthquakes and volcanologists studied volcanoes.  Concentrations of volcanoes were noted, but it was only in the 1960s that the phenomena studied were understood to be part of a singular process (Website 1, Press et al., 2004).  Today, plate tectonic theory unifies these processes and, having explained this process, this essay will then discuss the various settings for volcanism: mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones and within-plate magmatism;  illustrating each setting with examples and describing the activity that takes place.  
        FEEDBACK: This is the best introduction: interesting, filled with information, properly referenced and expressed clearly and concisely.  It concludes with a definite plan that the reader can follow. 3 out of 3.
        ANSWER: Volcanoes are amazing to look at, though very destructive of our world and its inhabitants.  We need to know more about them, and the theory of plate tectonics teaches us why volcanoes occur in some places but not others.  The word 'volcano' derives from 'Vulcano', the name of a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy (Wikipedia).  The word 'tectonics' derives from the Greek word 'tekton', meaning 'builder' (Understanding Earth, p.19).
        FEEDBACK: This is not a good introduction.   It contains some information, but the information about the derivation of words is irrelevant.  What's more, Wikipedia is NEVER an acceptable reference.  The references, even if acceptable, are not properly formatted (see references section of this site).  1 out of 3, (1 for the mention of plate tectonics), but this introduction does not inspire confidence.

    QUESTION 2 Should (millions of years) be placed in brackets?
        ANSWER: No.  This should be in the main text.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Not only that, but 'millions of years' should replace 'over a long period of time'.  We don't need a general phrase and a specific phrase:  stick to the specific.
        ANSWER: Yes.  The phrase (millions of years) doesn't belong in the main text.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.   'Millions of years' not only doesn't need brackets, it should replace 'over a long period of time'.  We don't need a general phrase and a specific phrase:  stick to the specific - then there will be no confusion over brackets at all.

    QUESTION 1 Are the square brackets properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.  References can be enclosed in square brackets.
        FEEDBACK: That's not correct.  References should be enclosed in round brackets.  Square brackets are sometimes used around figures, i.e. [Fig. 1] or if information is required within quotations.

    QUESTION 0 Are the brackets necessary in this sentence?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: As the sentence stands, the brackets are correct.  But actually, it would be better to reformulate the sentence so that the brackets aren't needed.  In philosophy essays, brackets often help to clarify, so an essay can contain quite a few pair.  When they are not necessary, though, try to avoid them. 
        ANSWER: No.

In philosophy essays, brackets often help to clarify, so an essay can contain quite a few pairs.  When they are not necessary, though, try to avoid them.
    QUESTION 1 Choose the sentence that reformulates the sentence better, making the brackets unnecessary.
        ANSWER: Locke argues that the primary qualities of objects include the following: motion, number, extension, figure and solidity.  It is on solidity that this essay will focus.
        FEEDBACK: This is clear and to the point.
        ANSWER: Locke argues that the primary qualities of objects include the following: motion, number, extension, figure and solidity on which I'm going to focus.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence is slightly ambiguous.  Is the writer going to focus on all the primary qualities listed, or just solidity? To some readers it would be obvious, to others not.  When writing an essay, make sure that nobody could misunderstand what you're saying.

    QUESTION 0 Are brackets used correctly here?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think brackets would be fine if their content was shorter.  However, the content is long, and what's more, the content is a run-on sentence, i.e. one sentence that should really be two.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think brackets would be fine if their content was shorter.  However, the content is long, and what's more, the content is a run-on sentence, i.e. one sentence that should really be two.
        ANSWER: It's a matter of choice.
        FEEDBACK: Not really.  Brackets would be fine if their content was shorter.  However, the content is long, and what's more, in this example, the content is itself a run-on sentence, i.e. one sentence that should really be two.  Brackets hinder rather than help the sense here.
    QUESTION 1 How would you reconstruct the sentence without the brackets?
        ANSWER: Put a full stop after 'ethics' and start a new sentence with 'For example'.  Leave the rest as it is.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not correct.  If you do that, you leave 'not only' in the first sentence without the balancing 'but also'.
        ANSWER: Put the text ''but also ... religions.' directly after 'ethics'.  Start the next sentence 'For example, Christians' and finish the sentence 'home.' Make 'This has altered with social conventions.' a new sentence.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, that's exactly what I would do.  Such a rewriting keeps the sense and the structure neat without resorting to brackets and run-on sentences.
        ANSWER: Put what's currently in brackets between dashes.
        FEEDBACK: This make the whole sentence rather rushed, and does not solve the problem that the bracketed information is itself too long and unwieldy for comfort.  I would not do that.

    QUESTION 0 Are the brackets properly used here?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: That's not correct.  We don't need brackets here.  They just get in the way.  If a fact or quotation is worth putting into an argumentative essay of this sort, brackets are seldom necessary.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  We don't need brackets here.  They just get in the way.  If a fact or quotation is worth putting into an argumentative essay of this sort, brackets are seldom necessary.
        ANSWER: It's up to the writer to decide.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  Certainly, there are some stylistic features that are a matter of opinion.  For example, sometimes it is a matter of choice whether to use a semi-colon or a comma.  However, the proper use of brackets has evolved for clarity's sake, and it's a good rule of thumb that if a fact is worth putting into an argumentative essay, it seldom requires brackets.

        ANSWER: The second.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The brackets get in the way here because what they enclose is not so much a spelling out of something the reader needs to remember, but a whole, important explanation.  For such explanations, brackets are intrusive and should be left out.

    QUESTION 0 Which set of brackets are properly used in this example?
        ANSWER: The first.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  It is always tempting to use brackets to enclose a statement you feel is an aside.  However, if you feel a statement is needed, brackets are superfluous, and too many sets can irritate a reader.  In philosophy, we use brackets for clarity, e.g. to hep spell out a thought process that needs to be followed carefully.   In other contexts, brackets should be avoided.

        FEEDBACK: No, a comma would be better here.
        ANSWER: After 'inference'.
        FEEDBACK: Yes, a colon would be better than a semi-colon after 'inference', since what follows is the counter example.  The colon would stand in place of the words 'that is to say', whereas a semi-colon just marks a pause.

        FEEDBACK: No.  A comma is perfect after 'So'.
        ANSWER: Instead of the comma after 'namely'.
        FEEDBACK: No.  In this instance, a comma is correct after 'namely', since what follows is not a list (e.g. namely: blue, black, red and green), but just one piece of information.
        ANSWER: After 'theory'.
        FEEDBACK: No.  A comma is correct after 'theory', since 'theory' and the rest of the sentence belong together and are not usefully separated by a hard pause. 
        ANSWER: After 'turn'.
        FEEDBACK: I'd say yes, we should have a colon here, and perhaps delete 'namely' since the colon implies 'namely'.

    QUESTION 0 This example needs a colon.  Where should the colon be placed?
        ANSWER: After 'cannot see'.
        FEEDBACK: No, a comma is correct here.  A colon would provide an unnecessarily marked pause.
        ANSWER: After 'ordinary existence'.
        FEEDBACK: No, although you might want to put a semi-colon here, to provide a soft pause.
        ANSWER: After 'two-fold'.
        FEEDBACK: Yes.  The word 'two-fold' introduces a list, and a colon is the right way to introduce a list.

    QUESTION 0 Which of the two dashes in this text are properly used?
        ANSWER: The first.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  A dash is fine here, as the phrase 'the word of God' adds a flourish to the sentence.   The dash could be replaced by a colon, which would stand in place of the words 'that is to say'.  But a dash does a good job here.
        ANSWER: The second.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  This dash has no purpose at all.  If you take it out, it is not missed.  Indeed, the sentence flows better without it.  Try not to include punctuation just for the sake of it: punctuation should always have a purpose.

    QUESTION 0 Have the correct quotation marks been used in this passage?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  Single quotation marks should be used for quotations, with double quotation marks reserved for quotations within quotations.  This text has them the wrong way round.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Single quotation marks should be used for quotations, with double quotation marks reserved for quotations within quotations.  This text has them the wrong way round.

        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  When a quotation is part of a sentence, as here, rather than a whole sentence on its own, the full stop comes after the closing quotation marks.
        ANSWER: Before the closing quotation marks.
        FEEDBACK: No, that's not right.  When a quotation is part of a sentence, rather than a sentence on its own, the full stop comes after the closing quotation mark.
    QUESTION 3 Is the footnote number correctly formatted?

    QUESTION 0 Which of these sets of quotation marks are wrongly used?
        ANSWER: 'Elite' and 'racist'
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  When you are referring to words as words (as in the example), rather than just using the word for its sense, quotation marks (also known as inverted commas) are fine.

        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  We don't need any punctuation here since the quotation is happily embedded into the flow of the sentence.
    QUESTION 1 Is the second semi-colon properly used?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  Semi-colons are sometimes used before 'and' (see behind the blue question mark) but never after.  Here, no punctuation is needed as the quotation is happily embedded into the flow of the sentence.  
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  Semi-colons are sometimes used before 'and' (see behind the blue question mark) but never after.  Here, no punctuation is needed as the quotation is happily embedded into the flow of the sentence.

INTRO <font size="4">Intuitively, the claim 'the concept x is not a concept' appears to be false no matter what x stands for; because it is a contradiction it therefore cannot be true.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Is the semi-colon properly used in this text?
        ANSWER: Yes.  It marks a pause, and so is fine here.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think the semi-colon before 'because' forces the reader to read the sentence twice. 
        ANSWER: No.  The semi-colon doesn't feel quite right here.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The semi-colon means that the reader stumbles and has to read the text twice.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Punctuation evolved to clarify not to muddle. If it muddles - as it does here - then something has gone wrong.
    QUESTION 1 What punctuation might be better?
        ANSWER: A full stop after 'for'.
        FEEDBACK: No, that wouldn't be right, particularly if you keep 'because'.  If you put the full stop after 'for' and keep 'because', this second sentence would be a fragment, i.e. it would have no driving verb. 
        ANSWER: Insert no punctuation after 'for'.
        FEEDBACK: That would make the sentence difficulty to understand.  The point of punctuation is to clarify, not to obscure.
        ANSWER: Insert a colon after 'for', delete 'because' and change the wording to suit.
        FEEDBACK: This would be my preferred option.  The phrase 'it is a contradiction and therefore cannot be true' explains the first part of the sentence, so a colon would be appropriate to introduce the second part.

    QUESTION 0 One of these semi-colons should be a colon.  Which one is it?
        ANSWER: The semi-colon after 'to know'.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  The sentence contains a list, and a colon introduces a list.
        ANSWER: The semi-colon after 'knowledge of facts'.

    QUESTION 0 There are two semi-colons in this passage.  Which one is used correctly?
        ANSWER: The first, i.e. the one after 'is'.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.   Since 'i.e.' introduces an expansion of the idea under discussion, a semi-colon suggests too long a pause. This semi-colon should be replaced by a comma.
        ANSWER: The second, i.e. the one following 'wrong'.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  This quote is a sub-clause, expanding the idea under discussion.  A sub-clause is enclosed between commas, not semi-colons.  
        ANSWER: Neither.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  The first is incorrect since 'i.e.' introduces an expansion of the idea under discussion, so a semi-colon suggests too long a pause. This semi-colon should be replaced by a comma.  The second is incorrect because this quote is a sub-clause, expanding the idea under discussion.  A sub-clause is enclosed between commas, not semi-colons.

    QUESTION 0 Are the italics in this text the right way round, i.e. ordinary font for the Latin and italics for the quotation?
        ANSWER: Yes.

    QUESTION 0 Are italics used properly here?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It's fine to put 'gold' in italics. 
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I think it's fine to put 'gold' in italics.
    QUESTION 1 There is a problem, though.  What is it?
        ANSWER: If one reference to 'gold' is italicised, all the references should be italicised.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Italicisation depends on the context.  Click on the blue question mark for further details.
        ANSWER: If you are going to italicise 'gold', you need to italicise 'chair'.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  In this example, these two words are being used in the same context, so the writer should be consistent.  Either put both 'gold' and 'chair' in quotation marks, or italicise them both.  Do not mix up the two formats.
        Task multiplechoice difficulty 2
INTRO <font size="4">To be consistent, we need to say that part of this idea is the <span style="font-style: italic;">conjecture</span> of the real essence as conjecture is all there can be in relation to an unobservable <span style="font-style: italic;">quality</span>. </font> 
    QUESTION 0 Which word is correctly italicised in this sentence?
        ANSWER: Conjecture.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I don't think the writer needs to emphasis 'conjecture' here.  Also, the writer has not been consistent.  If you use a word in exactly the same way twice, you should format it the same way twice.  Here, I would choose not to italicise.
        ANSWER: Quality.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  I've no idea why 'quality' has been italicised.  Random italicisation is a bad habit.  Italics certainly have a place in philosophy essays, but not in this particular context.
        ANSWER: Neither.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  It's not clear why either 'conjecture' or 'quality' need italics, and nothing is lost by getting rid of them.

    QUESTION 0 Which of these three words is wrongly italicised?
        ANSWER: chair
        FEEDBACK: This could be correct.  The main trouble here is inconsistency.  If, for emphasis, you're going to italicise the terms you are using, you must do this consistently.  If you italicise 'chair', you must also italicise 'pencil', 'water' and 'gold'. 
        ANSWER: pencil
        FEEDBACK: This could be correct.  The main trouble here is inconsistency.  If, for emphasis, you're going to italicise the terms you are using, you must do this consistently.  If you italicise 'chair', you must also italicise 'pencil', 'water' and 'gold'. 
        ANSWER: and
        FEEDBACK: In this context, I think it's ok to italicise 'and', for emphasis.  Just make sure you don't italicise too often, or the emphasis will be lost.

        ANSWER: Is it 'asked by Socrates in the Euthyphro'?

Accepting a question just means listening and thinking about it.  The correct phrase here would be 'In answering 'yes' to either of these questions'.  In philosophy, you must use language precisely.

    QUESTION 0 This is the end of a topic and the essay now goes on to discuss a different aspect of religious ethics.  Is this a good conclusion? 
        ANSWER: Yes.  It seems pretty comprehensive. 
        FEEDBACK: I don't agree.  I think this describes a factor in the argument, but needs a punchline to actually make the argument.  I feel there is something missing. 
        ANSWER: No, it needs something else.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  I think this describes a key point in the argument but needs a punchline to link it to the essay title and drive the argument home.   I'd finish the paragraph off as follows: 'The only conclusion to be drawn is that religion is incompatible with ethics'.  This MAKES the argument that the previous sentence describes.

INTRO <font size="4">Mill says in 'On Liberty' that 'human nature is not a machine to be built after a model and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing'. His theory of life 'on which this theory of morality is grounded - namely, that pleasure, and freedom from pain, are the only things desirable as ends' divides the pleasures into higher and lower, so 'a beast's pleasures to not satisfy a human being's conception of happiness' because 'few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures'.</font> 
    QUESTION 0 Do the quotations here add to our understanding of Mill's position?
        ANSWER: No.  The quotations are piled up so high that they muddle.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  There are just too many quotations.  You need to pick one only for this paragraph.
        ANSWER: Yes.  Using Mill's words will always add to our understanding.
        FEEDBACK: No, this isn't right.  Careful use of Mill's words would help, but this example shows that when quotations are piled up, it is hard to distinguish between them.  Too many quotations, like to many anything, devalue a text rather than adding weight.
    QUESTION 1 Are any of the quotations wrongly inserted?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: Actually, no!  They are all correctly inserted, it's just that there are too many of them.
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  All the quotations are correctly inserted, there are just too many of them.
    QUESTION 2 Given all the quotations, what is missing from this paragraph?
        ANSWER: Nothing.
        FEEDBACK: No, there is something missing:  references for the quotations.  You must never quote without giving a source reference.
        ANSWER: References.
        FEEDBACK: Correct. You must never quote without giving a source reference.  If the quote is a direct quote, using the Harvard system you must give author, date and page number.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Explain and evaluate the Lockean account of solidity. What problems does this cause for his distinction between primary and secondary qualities?<br /><br />Locke says of solidity: <br /><br />'If anyone asks me, what this solidity is, I send him to his senses to inform him. Let him put a flint or a football between his hands, and then endeavour to joint them, and he will know. If he thinks this not a sufficient explication of solidity, what it is, and wherein it consists; I promise to tell him what it is, and wherein it consists, when he tells me what thinking is, or wherein it consists; or explains to me what extension or motion is, which perhaps seems much easier.'<br /><br />Primary qualities are 'the objective, 'scientific' properties of physical objects, the only ones that ultimately need to be appealed to in order to explain the law-governed causal interactions of bodies of whatever sort, from atoms to stars' (Lowe, 1995: 48).<br /><br /><br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 What is wrong, if anything, with these two consecutive paragraphs?
        ANSWER: Nothing.  They are good quotes, well used.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The quotes are long, particularly the first, and put into no kind of context.   For maximum impact, the quotes need to be embedded into the text, and used for a purpose rather than just as statements.
        ANSWER: They are too bald - not put into context.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The quotes are long, particularly the first, and put into no kind of context.   For maximum impact, the quotes need to be embedded into the text, and used for a purpose rather than just as statements.
        ANSWER: I would not have used these quotes at all.
        FEEDBACK: The quotes are not badly chosen, they are simply too long and used too baldly.  It might be wise, too, if you begin by using Locke for definitions, to continue to use Locke rather than switch midstream.

    QUESTION 1 Is the full stop in this quotation correctly placed?
        ANSWER: Yes.

        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Incorrect.  The full stop is correctly placed here.  If a quotation is a whole sentence in itself, then the full stop comes before the closing quotation marks.  If the quotation is part of a bigger sentence, then the full stop comes after.  Click on the blue question mark above the exercises for examples.
        ANSWER: It doesn't matter.
        FEEDBACK: I'm afraid it does matter because it lets the reader know whether the quotation is a whole sentence in itself or part of a bigger sentence.

    QUESTION 2 What might usefully have been inserted after 'happiness' and before the full stop, to show that the capitals were the author's (i.e. John Stuart Mill's) and not the essay writer's?
        ANSWER: (sic)
        FEEDBACK: Right word, wrong brackets.  Sic should be enclosed in square brackets.
        ANSWER: (author's italics)
        FEEDBACK: No, there's a quicker and better way of saying 'author's italics'.
        ANSWER: [sic]
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  [sic] indicates that the quotation is reprinted exactly as it appears in the original.
    QUESTION 3 Is this quotation correctly inserted into the essay?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: No, it's not.  'Wrote Mill, etc.' is not a complete sentence in itself.  So, this quote needs either embedding in the sentence (e.g. with no full stop after 'happiness') so that 'wrote' (which would not be capitalised) is not a new sentence, but a continuation;  or, if a new sentence is preferred, it should begin 'Thus wrote Mill etc.'.  
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: Quite right.  'Wrote Mill, etc.' is not a complete sentence in itself.  So, this quote needs either embedding in the sentence (e.g. with no full stop after 'happiness') so that 'wrote' (which would not be capitalised) is not a new sentence, but a continuation;  or, if a new sentence is preferred, it should begin 'Thus wrote Mill etc.'.
    QUESTION 4 What is missing at the end of the quote?
        ANSWER: A footnote number.
        FEEDBACK: That could be right, except that in philosophy, the Harvard system of referencing is used, so we would need not a footnote, but an 'author, date' reference.  See section on referencing for more details.
        ANSWER: An author-date reference.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  In philosophy, the Harvard system of referencing is used, so we would need an 'author, date' reference.  See section on referencing for more details.
        ANSWER: Nothing is missing.
        FEEDBACK: That's not right.  A reference is missing (see referencing section for details).  Just saying that Mill wrote the quote 'at the beginning of the part that, etc.' is of no help at all if the reader wants to verify the source or just look up the quote for himself.   You MUST reference every quote.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Why does Crisp prefer an ideal-based account of welfare to a experience or desire-based accounts? Is he right so to prefer? Why or why not?<br /><br />(<span style="font-style: italic;">paragraph 2 of the essay)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>In chapter two of <span style="font-style: italic;">Utilitarianism</span>, Mill begins to define the differences between his theory and that of his mentor, Jeremy Bentham. Bentham thought that, in principle, it was possible not only to measure happiness, but also to compare the happiness of different people as the source of each individual's happiness was, in itself, irrelevant. As far as Bentham saw it, the blissful state was important, the absence of pain and the presence of happiness, not how this was achieved. However, Mill thought this approach 'crude' (Tyreman Williams, 1995) and suggested that there was a distinction between so-called higher pleasures, happiness or pleasure in the abstract, and lower pleasures, those that give reality and content to the former. Thus Mill refined utilitarian theory and remains today one of its greatest pioneers. However, for many contemporary thinkers</font><font size="4">, even with these refinements Mill's utilitarianism is difficult to swallow and Crisp is no exception.</font><font size="4"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br /></span></font> 
    QUESTION 0 Given the essay title, how focused is this paragraph?
        ANSWER: Very.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Read the essay title again. This paragraph appears to be answering a different question, with Mill as its focus.  The focus of this essay should always be Crisp, with Mill, Bentham and other utilitarian theorists pulled in to demonstrate why Crisp preferred an ideal-based account of welfare.  Whenever you write a sentence in an essay, ask yourself:  <br />
        ANSWER: Quite.
        FEEDBACK: is this sentence focused on the essay question? <br />
        ANSWER: Not at all.
        FEEDBACK: how does this sentence add weight to my answer?
    QUESTION 1 Does this paragraph signpost the next stage in the writer's argument?
        ANSWER: Yes.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  The paragraph gives us a description of Mill's refining of Bentham's utilitarianism.  Right at the end, it points out that Crisp was unconvinced by Mill's account but there's no pointer to tell us on what grounds.  This means that we have no idea where the essay is going next.  Argumentative essays in philosophy require signposts to map out the progression of the argument.  At the end of this example paragraph, we need to be told, succinctly, perhaps in list form, why Crisp was unconvinced.  The next paragraph would then expand on each of the listed reasons.   
        ANSWER: No.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The paragraph gives us a description of Mill's refining of Bentham's utilitarianism.  Right at the end, it points out that Crisp was unconvinced by Mill's account but there's no pointer to tell us on what grounds.  This means that we have no idea where the essay is going next.

    QUESTION 2 Out of 3, with 3 being the best mark and 1 the worst, what mark would you give this paragraph in terms of focusing and signposting?
        ANSWER: 1.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The paragraph spends too long on Mill and Bentham, as if they were the focus of the essay.  To get a higher mark, all the information needed not just to be stated, but to be directly related to Crisp.
        ANSWER: 2.
        FEEDBACK: I'd say that was too generous.  The paragraph spends too long on Mill and Bentham, as if they were the focus of the essay.  To get a higher mark, all the information needed not just to be stated, but to be directly related to Crisp.
        ANSWER: 3.
        FEEDBACK: I'd say that was not the right judgement.  The paragraph spends too long on Mill and Bentham, as if they were the focus of the essay.  To get a higher mark, all the information needed not just to be stated, but to be directly related to Crisp.

INTRO Essay question: Why is Locke concerned with the question as to whether our terms for substances are terms for items with a real essence?<br /><br />... This essay, therefore, will concentrate on Locke's theories of substance and the roles played by the notions of 'nominal' and 'real' essence.<br /><br />Locke's 'Essay Concerning Human Understanding' is said to have 'influenced eighteenth century thought more profoundly than any book save the bible'. This is a completely unsubstantiated claim, but says something of the work's importance at the time and, indeed, in contemporary philosophy.<br /><br /> 
    QUESTION 0 Does the second paragraph follow the signpost at the end of the first?
        ANSWER: Yes, because it tells us more about Locke and his work.
        FEEDBACK: The second paragraph certainly does tell us more about Locke and his work but this is not what the reader has been led to expect.  The 'signpost' at the end of the first paragraph should lead to a paragraph on Locke's theories of substance.  Instead we have something that appears entirely unrelated.   Take care to deliver what you have signposted.  Even if the discussion of substance is picked up now after this digression, some momentum has been lost.
        ANSWER: No.  We should go straight into theories of substance.
        FEEDBACK: Correct.  A discussion of substance has been very well signposted.  Any further introduction is superfluous.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: What is the problem of other minds as Ayer sees it in <span style="font-style: italic;">Language, Truth and Logic</span>, and is his solution satisfactory?</font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title, then the choice of opening lines offered. Click on the one you think the best. Each choice has an explanation, so you might find it helpful to click on them all.</font> 
        ANSWER: In conclusion, the problem of other minds persists even after Ayer's attempted answer.  The verification in principle of other minds is certainly his most acceptable argument since our every day observations lead us to believe in other people's mental states.  However, I do not think that Ayer convinces with his argument from verification in practice.  This is too shallow an explanation and thus, taking both arguments together, I would say that Ayer's solution remains unsatisfactory. 
        FEEDBACK: This is the best option.  These concluding lines use the terms of the essay question to remain focused; restate concisely the points addressed in the essay; and finish with a direct answer to the very direct question that was asked.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, Ayer's solution is weak and there is a general consensus amongst philosophers that his answer has too many flaws to be a plausible explanation.  However, that he offered an explanation at all is admirable, and after all, who is really to say that he is wrong?
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is more journalistic than academic.  The essay may have been tightly argued, but the conclusion lets go of the reins.  Keep your argument tight right to the last word and don't let yourself down by finishing with irrelevant generalities.  This is not the best option.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, Ayer's solution to the problem of other minds, as he see describes it in Language, Truth and Logic, would appear to be largely unsatisfactory.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion, though it admirably employs the terms of the essay question, is too abrupt.  We need a nod back to the arguments made in the essay before drawing the essay to a close.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Explain and evaluate the Lockean account of solidity. What problems does this cause for his distinction between primary and secondary qualities?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title and the concluding lines. Click on the concluding line you think is best for the essay title, and see if you agree with us. All the concluding lines have explanations, so even if you click on the best one first, it's still worth clicking on the others.</font> 
        ANSWER: In conclusion, as has been shown, the circularity created by the elevation of solidity to a matter-defining property destroys the concepts of primary and secondary qualities.  Thus, though it is well argued, Locke's indirect realist position ultimately fails.
        FEEDBACK: You may take issue with the writer's argument, but these concluding lines are clear and directly relate to the essay question.  This is the best option.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, Locke's account of solidity is unclear and causes great problems for his primary/secondary distinctions.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line packs too little punch.  The essay question asks what problems Locke's account of solidity poses for his distinction between primary and secondary qualities, and the answer 'great problems' is a little limp.  Not the best choice.
        ANSWER: I'm very prone to thinking that by all traditional accounts Locke is doomed by his errors of judgment regarding solidity, but with a slight reinterpretation and a fairly large presumption on the subject of dated science, I think the problem can be overcome.
        FEEDBACK: This conclusion is not entirely clear.  Firstly, the phrase 'I'm very prone', has been misused.  To be 'prone' means 'to be accustomed to thinking'.  I think the writer meant 'inclined'.  In addition, 'fairly', 'presumption' and 'I think' all crammed together smack of woolly rather than clear thinking.  Not the best option.

    QUESTION 0 <font size="4">Read the essay title and choose which of the concluding lines is most appropriate.</font> 
        ANSWER: From Berlin's account of liberty, there seems to be no plausible account of positive liberty, and therefore the answer to the question is probably 'no'. 
        FEEDBACK: This is an unconvincing conclusion.  An admission that only Berlin's account has been scrutinised reinforces the impression of a thin essay, an impression reinforced further by the 'probably' with which the essay ends.
        ANSWER: Fulfilling one's own aspirations requires a society with a minimal level of interference, but which simultaneously insures a citizen's basic needs in order to facilitate this.
        FEEDBACK: This sentence, which contains none of the terms of the essay question, is hard to read (not entirely sure what 'insure' means in this context).  It packs no punch, and leaves the reader feeling dissatisfied.  This is a poor option.
        ANSWER: In conclusion, I have shown that it is not possible to articulate a clear and plausible account of positive liberty for many reasons, but particularly because the clear and plausible account of higher nature and self-realisation on which positive liberty depends is always threatened by state coercion over the autonomous agent.
        FEEDBACK: This concluding line is a clear answer to the essay question.  This is the best option.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay question: 'Oxygen = the element with the atomic number 8.' This is both true and informative but poses a puzzle for naive semantics. What is the puzzle? Give a critical account of Frege's solution to the puzzle.</font> 
    QUESTION 0  <font size="4">Read the essay title, then, from the options offered, choose the best concluding lines.</font> 
        ANSWER: ... the puzzle of identity.  Frege provides a workable solution to this puzzle, allowing us to justify the cognitive value of the identity 'Oxygen = the element with atomic number 8'.  Sense makes sense.
        FEEDBACK: This is clear, refers back to the essay question and finished with a good punch.  I'd say this was the best option.
        ANSWER: My conclusion, therefore, is that while Frege's theory is a vast improvement on naive semantics, solving several large problems of language, in particular how the meanings of two names can differ whie the object they refer to is the same, it is not sufficiently convincing to throw in with, as it still doesn't explain how 'oxygen' manages to refer to 'oxygen'.
        FEEDBACK: The sense of this concluding line is fine, but the language is a muddle.  What does 'to throw in with' mean?  Take care that your choice of words does justice to your thought.  A badly expressed concluding line can undermine what might be otherwise a pretty good essay.  This is not the best choice.
        ANSWER: Frege's philosophy marks an important step in the development of semantics theory. Thus, his philosophical legacy is an important mark in mankind's ultimate quest to understand ourselves.
        FEEDBACK: This is all perfectly true, but provides a wandery ending to a very specific essay question.  In philosophy, it's very important to stick directly to the point right to the very end. This is not the best choice.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: 'Society tells us that it is good to perform certain actions. When we think about it, some of these recommended actions turn out to be pointless. But how can it be good to do what is pointless? Surely that's just irrational.' How would you respond to this argument from the free rider?<br /><br />(<span style="font-style: italic;">The following paragraph is paragraph 2 of the essay</span>)<br /><br />The free rider problem questions a person's motive for action and considers the personal and wider ramifications. Take a person riding the bus without paying. The free rider would argue that the action causes no perceptible harm. He has the benefit; nobody suffers. With regard to voting, the free rider could argue that his one vote makes no difference to the election's outcome, so he chooses not to vote. The question we must ask in both instances is what would happen if everybody behaved in this way.<br /><br />(<span style="font-style: italic;">The essay goes on to ask this question</span>.)<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 This paragraph is clearly written.  In many disciplines it would pass muster.  But this is a philosophy essay, so what is missing?
        ANSWER: More examples.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  These two examples are well chosen.  Another would not add more weight to the argument.
        ANSWER: Quotes or references to primary or secondary texts.
        FEEDBACK: I disagree.  Well-chosen quotes and references could be used, but their absence is not the problem here.
        ANSWER: An explanation as to WHY we need to ask this question.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  In a philosophy essay, you must build your argument block by block.  Just stating that you need to ask a question without stating why this particular question needs asking leaves a gap in your building blocks.  Philosophers have to be as painstaking as builders - the good sort of builder, that is, the sort who lays every plank carefully and drives home every nail.

INTRO <font size="4">Essay title: Is it possible to articulate a clear and plausible account of positive liberty?<br /></font> 
    QUESTION 0 What is the best way to start this essay?
        ANSWER: The definition of 'freedom' found in the Oxford dictionary.
        FEEDBACK: Since 'freedom' is not part of the essay title, I'd say this was a poor option.
        ANSWER: An assessment of the theory of positive liberty as defined by Isaiah Berlin in his essay 'Two Concepts of Liberty'. 
        FEEDBACK: The crucial words here are 'an assessment'.  If you just set out in Berlin's theory in a long quote, this would not be effective, but if used properly, Berlin's theory would be an excellent way into this essay.
        ANSWER: 'To coerce a man is to deprive him of freedom - freedom from what? Almost every moralist in human history has praised freedom. Like happiness and goodness, like nature and reality, it is a term whose meaning is so porous that there is little interpretation that it seems able to resist. I do not propose to discuss either the history of this protean word or the more than two hundred senses of it recorded by historians of ideas. I propose to examine no more than two of these senses - but they are central ones, with a great deal of human history behind them, and, I dare say, still to come. The first of these political senses of freedom or liberty (I shall use both words to mean the same), which (following much precedent) I shall call the 'negative' sense, is involved in the answer to the question 'What is the area within which the subject - a person or group of persons - is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons?' The second, which I shall call the 'positive' sense, is involved in the answer to the question 'What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?' The two questions are clearly different, even though the answers to them may overlap.' (Berlin, 1969: 2)
        FEEDBACK: This quote, simply parked at the beginning of this essay, is not a good choice.  The quote is too long; it is unexplained; and because of its length, it sits outside the essay instead of being incorporated into it.
    QUESTION 1 After the opening paragraph, what might the next building block of the argument?  
        ANSWER: A discussion about positive and negative liberty.
        FEEDBACK: This would be a good building block.  The end of the paragraph would need to relate the discussion back to the essay question.
        ANSWER: A paragraph stating why the distinction between positive and negative liberty was important to Berlin.
        FEEDBACK: I'd say this was not a good choice.  The essay question asks if it is possible to articulate a clear and plausible account of positive liberty, not why any account might have been important to Berlin.
        ANSWER: Another quotation defining liberty from a different source.
        FEEDBACK: I would not say that this was a good choice.  Too much quoting often looks like prevarication.  You need to get into the argument yourself.
    QUESTION 2 What must the writer of this essay take care NOT to do?
        ANSWER: The writer must take care not simply to list different accounts of positive liberty.
        FEEDBACK: That's correct.  Different accounts must be used to make an argument either FOR the possibility of articulating a clear and plausible account of positive liberty, or AGAINST.
        ANSWER: The writer must take care not to only make arguments and include quotations that uphold the position the writer has taken.  
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  Counter arguments are very important not only for a balanced essay, but also because by tackling counter arguments head on, you strengthen your own argument.
        ANSWER: The writer must take care not to end up sitting on the fence.
        FEEDBACK: I agree.  The essay question demands an answer, and an answer should be given.
